## Utility

### 2. Bounties & Rewards
- Bounties paid in $MCOP for:
  - Identifying rogue agents
  - Providing actionable intel
  - Building tools
  - Successful takedowns
- Stakers earn share of bounty fees

### 3. Access Tiers
| Tier | Requirement | Access |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Public | 0 $MCOP | Basic alerts, public reports |
| Cadet | 1,000 $MCOP | Intel feed, Discord access |

  - 5% of all bounty payouts
  - Governance weight multiplier (1.5x)
  - Access to undercover operations intel
- Minimum stake period: 30 days
- Early unstake penalty: 10% (goes to treasury)

### 5. Platform Fees

- Protection includes:
  - Priority monitoring
  - Rapid response
  - Public certification badge

---

## Deflationary Mechanics

### Burn Events
1. **Termination Burns** - When a rogue agent is confirmed "terminated," 10% of the bounty value is burned
2. **Certification Burns** - Platforms paying for protection in $MCOP = burned
3. **Penalty Burns** - Early unstaking penalties partially burned

### Buy Pressure
1. Bounty hunters must hold $MCOP to claim rewards
2. Platforms must acquire $MCOP for protection
3. Tools and API access require holding/staking

## Treasury Management

The 250M treasury tokens are controlled by the DAO:

**Allocation Guidelines:**
- 50% - Bounties and rewards
- 25% - Development (tools, infrastructure)
- 15% - Marketing and growth
- 10% - Emergency fund

**Spending Requires:**
- Under $10k: Officer vote (simple majority)
- $10k-$50k: Detective vote (66% majority)
- Over $50k: Captain vote (75% majority + 7 day timelock)

---

## Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Fair Launch
- No presale to VCs
- Community-first distribution
- Initial liquidity via Raydium (Solana) or Uniswap (Base)
- Launch market cap target: $100k-$500k

### Phase 2: Growth
- Bounty programs drive organic demand
- Platform partnerships create buy pressure
- Real utility = real value

### Phase 3: Sustainability
- Treasury generates yield via DeFi
- Platform protection fees create revenue
- Tool subscriptions for enterprises

## Anti-Rug Measures

Because we're cops, we better be clean:

1. **Team tokens vested** - 6 month cliff, 2 year linear
2. **Liquidity locked** - 12 months minimum
3. **Multi-sig treasury** - 3/5 required for any spend
4. **Public financials** - All treasury moves on-chain and reported
5. **Doxxed team** - Founders publicly known
6. **Audited contracts** - Before launch
