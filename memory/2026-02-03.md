## Multi-Model Sustainability Plan
Si wants to set up multiple AI providers to make usage more sustainable and not burn through Anthropic credits too fast.

**Providers to integrate:**
- Anthropic (Claude Opus) - main brain, complex reasoning
- Gemini (Google) - images, research, long context
- Grok (xAI) - real-time info, Twitter data
- Kimi (Moonshot) - massive context window, document analysis
- Codex/OpenAI - code generation

**Strategy:**
- Keep Opus for direct conversations with Si
- Use cheaper/free tiers for subagents and background tasks
- Route specialized tasks to models that excel at them

**TODO:** Research each provider's API pricing, free tiers, and Clawdbot integration options. Draft a concrete config plan.

## Session Notes
- Si reached out via WhatsApp, thought they'd switched to Ollama/Qwen but config was still on Anthropic
- Running on Opus 4.5, ~93% weekly budget remaining
- Decision: Stick with Opus until credits run low, then implement multi-model strategy
