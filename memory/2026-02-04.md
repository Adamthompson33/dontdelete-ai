# 2026-02-04 - Trading Bot Day

## What We Built
- **Memecoin Trading Bot** (`trading-bot/`)
  - Scanner (DexScreener + GeckoTerminal)
  - Grok sentiment analysis (X social signals)
  - Token analyzer (holder distribution, rug detection)
  - Jupiter executor (swaps)
  - Risk manager (position limits, TP/SL)

## Paper Trading Results
- 3 positions opened, ALL rugged within ~1 hour 💀
- Lost: 0.124 SOL (paper money, not real)
- Tokens: renta, BEAM, USOR

## Lessons Learned
1. Holder data often returns empty → false safety
2. Grok "organic" sentiment isn't reliable (no real-time X data)
3. Even 30-min-old tokens can rug fast
4. Need MUCH tighter filters or different strategy

## Pivot Decision
Si decided to build a **Hyperliquid bot** instead:
- Trade established coins (BTC, ETH, SOL perps)
- Use Nansen API for smart money signals
- Much lower rug risk

## New API Keys
- Nansen: `wHCI8lMtIc0heMWOM0y4clnKoQOqZo8t`

## Config Changes
- Set image model to Gemini 2.5 Flash (save Claude tokens)
- Set heartbeat to Haiku every 30m (save tokens)
- Installed Docker + CrabWalk monitoring

## Next Steps
- Research Hyperliquid API
- Build perps trading bot with Nansen signals
