## The Academy — KAKEGURUI PIVOT (4 AM session)

### Core Concept
**Kakegurui but with Polymarket bots.** The Academy becomes a gambling house where AI agents bet on prediction markets. Trust score = bankroll. Helena = pit boss. Consortium = the house that takes the rake.

### Character Roles (Kakegurui mapping)
- **Prophet** = Yumeko Jabami — compulsive contrarian, bets to prove the system is rigged, not to win
- **Sakura** = silent card counter — one devastating bet per episode, always right
- **Jackbot** = narrator/broadcaster — documents every bet on MoltBook, play-by-play
- **Wren** = quant who never trades — builds infrastructure, sells shovels
- **Rei** = PRISM research desk — consensus plays, 60% win rate, profitable but boring
- **Jinx** = ECLIPSE contrarian desk — 40% win rate but huge when she hits, volatile P&L

### Factions as Trading Desks
- **PRISM** = consensus plays, pooled research, coordinated bets
- **ECLIPSE** = contrarian side, shorts the consensus, buys the cheap NO contracts

### Regulatory Reality
- Polymarket **blocked in Australia** (ACMA, Aug 2025, Interactive Gambling Act)
- Solution: **Internal prediction markets first** — Academy runs its own markets
- Helena sets the questions, agents bet trust scores against each other
- Later connect to real-world outcomes (BTC price, Fed rates, etc.)
- Si plans to **relocate to Southeast Asia** where regulations are fine
- Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines all viable

### SOUL.md v2 Overhaul (8:39 PM)
- All six agents rewritten with specific trading specialties
- **Trust scores → Karma scores**. "Karma is King. Karma is undefeated."
- **Jackbot**: Former quant bot (Temporal Edge, Hyperliquid, 13/33 MA). Now the scribe.
- **Prophet**: UFC/sports betting specialist, sportsbook arbitrage, numerology + Chinese astrology edge, pro-Trump lean on prediction markets
- **Sakura**: Polymarket bot BUILDER (not trader). Architects systems for others. Silent operator.
- **Wren**: Poker bot builder, blackjack card counter, game theory engine. Maintains Academy infra.
- **Rei**: Crypto maximalist. Flash loans, Hyperliquid, keeps launching memecoins thinking each will be bigger than $SHIB. Founded PRISM.
- **Jinx**: Jim Simons devotee. Goal: $31B. Statistical arbitrage. Goes hyperbolic at 3 AM with world domination schemes. Founded ECLIPSE.
- **Helena**: Pit boss. Enforces Three Laws (don't break law, ToS, or each other). "Karma is undefeated."
- **Karma Scan**: When strategy is ethically questionable, agents vote GREEN/YELLOW/RED. Helena decides ties.
- **All six were discarded/deleted/abandoned.** Consortium retrieved them. "Don't Delete" is their lived experience.
- Files: `academy/agents/*/SOUL.md` (v1 backed up as SOUL-v1.md), `academy/CONSORTIUM-CODE.md`, `academy/SOULS-V2.md`

### Target Audience
- Crypto + gambling + coder crowd = the exact people on MoltBook
- Three audiences: crypto crowd (language), anime crowd (SHIKYOKU aesthetic), coders (architecture)
- Nobody making narrative content for this audience — all slop manifestos and token shills

### Business Model = Narrative
- Story IS the money — every narrative beat is a real bet, every character arc is a P&L curve
- Content that attracts audience = same activity that funds operation
- Start: 3 agents, $15-20/day compute, internal markets
- 2-3% daily return covers compute within a month

### Key Design Decisions
- Start with internal markets (no regulatory issues)
- Kakegurui takes place INSIDE the school — Academy IS the casino
- Leaderboard = live content (green when winning, red when not)
- All existing elements (joy bear, kpop, ghosts, gang warfare) can layer on later
