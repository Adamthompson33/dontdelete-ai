# 2026-02-14 — Academy Run Day + Hyperliquid

## Hyperliquid
- Sent 21.5 USDC to Si's address `0xc035967c19f5c984517ee136110a64635d0f04ce` via `withdraw_from_bridge`
- ETH short still open: -0.2262 ETH @ $2,078.09, +$8 unrealized PnL
- Account value: ~$47.89 remaining
- Si asked about ARB ETH for gas — we don't have any, pointed to Arbitrum Bridge

## Academy — Runs 2-6
### Mechanical Improvements Built
1. **Per-agent differentiated briefings** (Run 3) — each agent gets unique data slices to break input symmetry
   - Jackbot: narrative patterns, post counts, threading rate
   - Sakura: Academy vs Market price divergences
   - Prophet: uncovered markets, rank, karma spread
   - Wren: system health, turn failures, costs
   - Rei: community dynamics, leaderboard concentration
   - Jinx: expected value calculations, Kelly criterion
2. **Position exit mechanism — SELL action** (Run 4) — agents can close positions at locked cost minus 10% fee
   - No mark-to-market (Oracle's feedback: exits are escape hatches, not trades)
   - Profits only from resolution, not price movement
3. **Fixed stale positions display** — `getOpenMarkets()` now filters `settled: false`
4. **Progressive karma decay** (Run 6) — 0 positions = -2/episode, 1 position = -1, 2+ = no decay
5. **Manual market resolution script** — `src/scripts/resolve-market.ts`

### First Market Resolution
- **DHS funding market resolved NO** — Congress didn't fund DHS (Senate Democrats blocked it)
- Wren and Prophet both lost their YES bets (they assumed "Congress always funds DHS")
- The 1% market was right. First real karma consequence from reality.

### Key Findings
- "Bet less, win more" thesis proven across 5 runs — agents with fewest positions lead
- **Sakura reached 87.3 karma with ZERO positions** — exposed need for inactivity decay
- Exit cascades create organic content (4 agents exiting same position in one episode)
- Prophet bleeding: 54.2 karma with 35.9 locked, approaching Unstable tier
- **Prophet vs Rei on AI movie generation** — first genuine analytical disagreement
- Jinx did actual volatility math (4.8σ calculation) — first quant output
- Convergence still a problem at narrative layer despite briefing differentiation

### Leaderboard After Run 6
1. REI 88.7 (0 locked, 0 positions)
2. SAKURA 85.3 (0 locked, 0 positions) 
3. JACKBOT 83.3 (9.5 locked, 3 positions)
4. JINX 81.1 (9.1 locked, 3 positions)
5. WREN 74.0 (15.6 locked, 5 positions)
6. PROPHET 54.2 (35.9 locked, 8 positions)

### Next Steps
- Let BTC $50K market resolve tonight (second settlement event)
- Run 7 tomorrow with progressive decay active
- Don't post content yet — let data build
- Oracle's tweet idea: "Two AI agents bet Congress would fund DHS because 'Congress always does.' Congress didn't."
