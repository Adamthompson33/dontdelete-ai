## KEY CORRECTIONS TO GG33 SCORING MODEL

### 1. 9 Life Path vs Universal Year Interaction
- **2025 (UY9):** 9 LP was in HARMONY — same frequency, comfortable energy. Garry's 9 LP win at Qatar makes sense: he was riding compatible UY9 energy PLUS Ox trine. Not overcoming a drag.
- **2026 (UY1):** 9 LP is in DIRECT OPPOSITION — 1 (beginnings) vs 9 (endings) = clashing forces. 9 LP should be UPGRADED as a fade factor in 2026, not downgraded.
- **Oracle had this backwards** — corrected by Si. 1 and 9 are opposites in numerology.
- **9 PY (Personal Year) remains the strongest fade signal** — endings energy regardless of universal year
- **In 2026: Both 9 LP AND 9 PY are strong fades** — 9 LP because it opposes UY1, 9 PY because it always signals endings
- Evidence from 2025 backtests: Royval (9 LP) lost at Vegas 112 due to other stacking negatives, not necessarily 9 LP drag. Garry (9 LP) won because 9 LP was harmonious in UY9 + Ox trine.

### 2. Horse Year = LUCKY for Horse fighters
- GG33 says the Chinese tradition of Ben Ming Nian (own year = unlucky) is WRONG/misinformation
- Born in Horse year is lucky in Horse year according to GG33
- This means Phil Rowe (Horse) gets a BOOST at FN 267, not a penalty

### 3. Contract Year Rules (Two Distinct Patterns)
- **Rule A: Contract year vs CURRENT Universal Year** — e.g., Fiziev's Pig contract clashing with Snake year negated his Rooster energy. Chikadze's Pig contract in Snake year = first KO loss ever. Medić's Rat contract vs Horse year at FN 267.
- **Rule B: Signing IN your bad luck year** — e.g., Leal signing as Dog in Dragon year = career curse. Less of a primary fade trigger, more of a tiebreaker/secondary factor.
- Rule A seems to be what 7TN7 acts on more aggressively

### 4. 7TN7's Evolution
- Started betting UFC purely on GG33 a few years ago
- Now layers in fight knowledge + YouTube UFC capper consensus
- His edge: knowing WHICH filter to trust on WHICH fight
- Cosmic gives him the shortlist, fight IQ gives conviction/sizing
- Posts wins, underdogs, props publicly. Buries losses quietly.
- His public feed = highlight reel of convergence plays (GG33 + fight IQ aligned)

## @7THENUMBER7 PICK TRACKING

### UFC 324: Gaethje vs Pimblett (Jan 24-25, 2026) — Record: 4W 1L
| Pick | Type/Size | Result | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Hokit | Parlay leg (×2 parlays) | ✅ WIN | "Cashes 1st legs of 2 parlays" |
| C Johnson (LOSS) | Straight? | ❌ LOSS | Picked Johnson (Jan 10 bday, 22 LP, Horse), bet 1 energy over Perez's 9 LP in Universal Year 1. Johnson got KO'd by Perez R1. Brushed over loss quietly. |
| Krylov | Dog / parlay leg | ✅ WIN | "LIVE DOG KRYLOV SMASHED HIM SUBS" — submission |
| Cortez-Acosta | Parlay leg | ✅ WIN | "Checks leg 1" |
| Natalia Silva | Parlay cash | ✅ WIN | "Cashes a parlay after a couple big dogs" |
| 3 UNIT MAX play | Unknown fighter | ? | "Killer card... 3 unit max" — didn't reveal who |

**Johnson Pick Logic (WHY IT LOST):**
- Born Jan 10 → Day energy = 1
- Life Path 22 (master number)
- Horse sign → Horse year incoming (Feb 17, but event Jan 25 = still Snake year)
- Bet: 1 energy aligns with 2026 Universal Year 1, fade Perez's 9 LP
- But Perez still flatlined Johnson despite the "wrong" energy

### UFC 325: Volkanovski vs Lopes 2 (Jan 31 - Feb 1, 2026) — Record: 4W 0L
| Pick | Type/Size | Result | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Ofli | Straight? | ✅ WIN | "BIG DOGGIE" — underdog |
| Ruffy | Straight 2u | ✅ WIN | Mauricio Ruffy over Fiziev |
| Saint-Denis/Hooker Under 2.5 rds | Prop 2u | ✅ WIN | "Fight not to start round 3" |
| Volkanovski + Under 4.5 | 2 plays | ✅ WIN | "Cashes 2 plays" |

**Key Insights:**
- Ruffy picked because Fiziev signed UFC in Pig year — negated his Rooster energy (Rule A contract curse)
- Ofli = 11 LP (Universal Year alignment) Rooster with 19 secondary, PY7, signed Dragon year. Rooster energy peaks at end of Snake year.
- YiZha = Double 8 LP Rat, PY19, signed Tiger year — weaker cosmic profile

### UFC FN: Bautista vs Oliveira (Feb 7-8, 2026) — Record: 2W 3L
| Pick | Type/Size | Result | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Barriault +370 | Dog 1u | ❌ LOSS | "Fought a hell of a fight, worth every bit" |
| Matsumoto | ? | ❌ LOSS | Bad decision, "2 judges gave Basharat R2" — robbery |
| Kaziev (Kuniev) ML +136 | TOP PLAY | ✅ WIN | "Easy UD" |
| Horiguchi | ? | ❌ LOSS | Picked against GG33 (Albazi had better GG33) — fight knowledge override |
| Bautista | Parlay 2u + straight 1u | ✅ WIN | Main event cash |

**Key Insights:**
- Horiguchi pick = weakness in his system. Overrode GG33 because he rates Horiguchi (ATT) higher than Albazi. Classic "I know fighters" override.
- Matsumoto — GG33 had him favored but judges blew it (robbery). System was right, execution failed.
- His most profitable picks (Kaziev +136) = where he trusted numbers over public perception

### UFC Vegas 112: Royval vs Kape (Dec 13, 2025) — Record: 3W 1L
| Pick | Result | Cosmic Alignment? | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Kape | ✅ WIN | ✅ YES — 11 LP Rooster in Snake year trine, Ox contract trine | Annihilated Royval |
| Vallejos | ✅ WIN | ✅ YES — Snake in Snake year (own year lucky), Snake contract | First to ever KO Chikadze |
| Costa | ✅ WIN | ✅ YES — Opponent Charrière was Pig in Snake year (bad luck) | |
| Thomson | ❌ LOSS | ❌ NO — Brito had Master 11 LP + Ox contract trine | Picked against cosmic |

**Key Discoveries:**
- Contract curse 2/2: Chikadze (Pig contract in Snake year) got KO'd for FIRST TIME EVER. Dragon durability broken by contract curse.
- Master 11 LP went 2-0 (Kape, Brito)
- 3-0 when cosmic aligned, 0-1 when not
- Pig-in-Snake-year: 3/3 losses (Charrière, Chikadze's contract, third instance)

### UFC Qatar: Tsarukyan vs Hooker (Nov 22, 2025) — Record: 6W 1L
| Pick | Type | Result | Cosmic Alignment? |
|------|------|--------|-------------------|
| Tsarukyan | Straight | ✅ WIN R2 Sub | ✅ |
| Ian Garry by DEC | Method | ✅ WIN UD (correct method!) | Mixed — 9 LP but Ox trine override |
| Volkan Oezdemir | Straight | ✅ WIN R1 KO | ✅ — Snake in Snake year + Rooster contract trine |
| Orolbai by KO | Method | ✅ WIN R1 KO (correct method!) | ✅ |
| Riley in R2 | Round | ✅ WIN R2 KO (correct round!) | ✅ |
| Topuria | Straight | ✅ WIN UD | ✅ — Opponent had 9 PY endings |
| Loder | Straight | ❌ LOSS R1 KO | ❌ — Flat cosmic, hype pick |

**Key Discoveries:**
- Oezdemir: Snake in Snake year with Rooster contract trine = DOUBLE cosmic stack → walked through Menifield in 87 seconds. 2/2 for "own zodiac year" fighters winning by early KO.
- Garry BROKE the 9 LP fade — but only because DOUBLE Ox trine overrode it. Key nuance: 9 is a drag, not death sentence. When alone = 3/3 losses. When paired with trine = 3/3 wins.
- Some picks were YouTube capper consensus (Orolbai by KO, Garry by DEC, Riley in R2) not purely GG33

---

## AGGREGATE 7TN7 RECORD: 19W - 6L (76%)
- When cosmic + fight IQ aligned: high win rate
- Losses tend to be: overriding GG33 with fight knowledge (Horiguchi), flat cosmic picks (Thomson, Loder), or robbery decisions (Matsumoto)

---

## UFC FN 267: STRICKLAND vs HERNANDEZ (Feb 21, 2026)

### Event Energy
- Date: February 21, 2026
- Location: Houston, Texas (Monkey City)  
- Year: Horse (CNY 2026 = Feb 17, so Feb 21 = Horse year)
- Day energy: 6 with 3 secondary energy
- Horse year trine: Tiger, Horse, Dog
- Monkey city trine: Monkey, Rat, Dragon
- Horse year clash: Rat (bad luck year for Rat fighters)

### Si's Picks: Neal, Ige, Smith, Judice, Edwards, Coria, Alibi, Njokuani

### PRELIM PREDICTIONS (8 bouts)

#### Bout 1: Njokuani vs Leal (WW)
- **Njokuani:** 33 LP (Master), Dragon, PY7, 4 secondary, signed Ox year
- **Leal:** 5 LP, Dog, PY9, 4 secondary, signed Dragon year (BAD LUCK — Dog's enemy)
- **Pick: Njokuani** — Dragon-Monkey city trine + Leal's bad luck contract
- Leal's PY9 = endings energy fade

#### Bout 2: Osbourne vs Alibi Idiris (FLW)
- **Osbourne:** 4 LP, Goat, PY20 (hidden 11), 9 secondary, signed Pig year (ally)
- **Alibi:** 1 LP, Dog, PY5, 22 secondary (Master), signed Snake year
- **Pick: Alibi** — 1 LP + Dog year alignment + master 22 secondary, but LOW confidence (unproven)
- Osbourne born on 9th = potential red flag

#### Bout 3: Coria vs Gurule (FLW)
- **Coria:** 1 LP, Tiger, PY19, 6 secondary, signed Snake year
- **Gurule:** 4 LP, Rooster, PY9, 7 secondary, signed Dragon year
- **Pick: Coria** — 1 LP Tiger in Horse year trine = PARLAY LOCK. Best cosmic profile on prelim card.
- Gurule's PY9 = fade

#### Bout 4: Cornolle vs Edwards (BW)
- **Cornolle:** 9 LP, Snake, PY9, 6 secondary, signed Cat year
- **Edwards:** 44 LP (Master), Pig, PY11 (Master), 11 secondary (Master), signed Rat year
- **Pick: Edwards** — TRIPLE master number energy (44/11/11). Fade Cornolle's double-9 (LP + PY).
- Widest cosmic gap on the card

#### Bout 5: Brahimaj vs Soriano (WW)
- **Brahimaj:** 4 LP, Monkey, PY19, 8 secondary, signed Rat year (Monkey trine ally)
- **Soriano:** 9 LP, Monkey, PY6, 22 secondary (Master), signed Pig year
- **Pick: Brahimaj** — Fade Soriano's 9 LP (though weaker factor in 2026), Brahimaj's Rat contract = Monkey trine ally
- ⚠️ RECALIBRATION NEEDED: 9 LP less important in Universal Year 1

#### Bout 6: Lebosnoyani vs Phil Rowe (WW)
- **Lebosnoyani:** 11 LP (Master), Tiger (1998), PY20 (hidden 11), 9 secondary, signed Snake year
- **Rowe:** 8 LP, Horse, PY7, 9 secondary, signed Pig year
- **Likely: PASS** — Cosmic says Lebosnoyani (11 LP, Tiger trine) but Rowe's Horse year = LUCKY (not unlucky as Ben Ming Nian myth says), and he's a crafty late-round fighter vs unproven debutant

#### Bout 7: Del Valle vs Leavitt (FW)
- **Del Valle:** 7 LP, Rat, PY9, 11 secondary (Master), signed Dragon year (Rat trine!)
- **Leavitt:** 5 LP, Pig, PY8, 2 secondary, signed Rat year
- **Pick: Del Valle** — but risky. Rat-Horse year clash + PY9 endings + Dulgarian scandal cloud. Undefeated (10-0) and physically superior.
- Leavitt just came OUT of his bad luck year (Pig in Snake year 2025), moving down in weight for first time

#### Bout 8: Judice vs Miller (WFLW)
- **Judice:** 33 LP (Master), Cat/Rabbit, PY5, 2 secondary, signed Cat year (own year)
- **Miller:** 1 LP, Rat, PY3, 7 secondary, signed Tiger year
- **Pick: Judice** — Master 33 LP + Miller's Rat-Horse year clash. But huge favorite, no straight bet value. Parlay leg only.

### MAIN CARD FIGHTERS (birthdays confirmed)

| Fighter | DOB | Zodiac | LP | PY | Secondary | Contract Year |
|---------|-----|--------|----|----|-----------|---------------|
| Sean Strickland | Feb 27, 1991 | Goat | 13 | ? | 9 | Horse (2014) |
| Anthony Hernandez | Oct 18, 1993 | Rooster | ? | 11 (Master) | ? | Dog (2018/2019) |
| Geoff Neal | Aug 28, 1990 | Horse | 1 | 1 | 1 | Rooster (2017) |
| Uroš Medić | Apr 25, 1993 | Rooster | 33 (Master) | 3 | ? | Rat (2020) ⚠️ CONTRACT CURSE (Rat vs Horse year) |
| Dan Ige | Aug 6, 1991 | Goat | 7 | ? | 6 | Rooster/Pig (2017/2019) |
| Melquizael Costa | Sep 14, 1996 | Rat | 3 | ? | 5 | ? |
| Serghei Spivac | Jan 24, 1995 | Dog | 4 | 8 | 6 | ? |
| Ante Delija | Aug 7, 1990 | Horse | 7 | 7 | 7 | ? |
| Jacobe Smith | Jan 17, 1996 | Pig | 7 | ? | 8 | ? |
| Seokhyeon Ko | Sep 24, 1993 | Rooster | 1 | 7 | 6 | ? |
| Zach Reese | Mar 24, 1993/1994 | Rooster/Dog | 4/5 | 1 | 6 | Dragon (2024) ⚠️ BAD LUCK SIGNING if Dog |
| Michel Pereira | Oct 6, 1993 | Rooster | 11 (Master) | 8 | 6 | Pig (?) |

### MAIN CARD KEY READS
- **Hernandez has cosmic edge over Strickland** — Master 11 PY + Dog contract trine. Strickland's profile is flat.
- **Neal over Medić** — Medić has Rat contract curse in Horse year (same pattern as Fiziev). Despite Master 33 LP, the contract curse overrides.
- **Ige over Costa** — Rat in Horse year is the enemy sign fade for Costa
- **Reese's birth year uncertainty matters** — if 1994 (Dog), he gets Horse year trine but signed in bad luck Dragon year. If 1993 (Rooster), different profile entirely.

### STRONGEST PLAYS ON THE CARD
1. **Coria** — Parlay anchor. 1 LP Tiger in Horse year trine.
2. **Edwards** — Triple master number stacking vs Cornolle's double-9.
3. **Ige** — Rat-Horse enemy sign fade on Costa.
4. **Neal** — Contract curse on Medić (Rat contract in Horse year).

## BACKTESTING PATTERNS CONFIRMED

### Contract Curse (Rule A: Contract vs Current Year)
- Fiziev (Pig contract in Snake year) — LOST ✅
- Chikadze (Pig contract in Snake year) — LOST, first KO ever ✅
- Medić (Rat contract in Horse year) — PREDICTION: LOSS

### Own Zodiac Year = Lucky (GG33 overrides Ben Ming Nian)
- Vallejos (Snake in Snake year) — WON ✅
- Oezdemir (Snake in Snake year) — WON by R1 KO ✅
- Rowe (Horse in Horse year) — PREDICTION: boosted

### Master 11 LP
- Kape (11 LP) — WON ✅
- Brito (11 LP) — WON ✅
- Lebosnoyani (11 LP) — PREDICTION: cosmic edge

### 9 Personal Year = Endings Fade
- Consistent fade signal across all events
- Different from 9 LP which is context-dependent on Universal Year

### Trine Override
- When 9 LP is paired with zodiac trine: 3/3 WINS (overrides the drag)
- When 9 LP stands alone: 3/3 LOSSES

---

## WHERE SESSION ENDED — CORRECTED
Oracle had 9 LP backwards. Si corrected:
- 9 LP is WORSE in 2026 (UY1) than 2025 (UY9) because 1 and 9 are opposing forces
- 2025: 9 LP was harmonious with UY9 (same frequency)
- 2026: 9 LP clashes with UY1 (beginnings vs endings)
- This means FN 267 sheet 9 LP fades are STRONGER than originally written, not weaker
- Soriano (9 LP) fade in Bout 5 is reinforced
- Cornolle (9 LP + 9 PY) in Bout 4 is an even bigger fade in UY1

### Recalibration needed on FN 267 sheet:
1. UPGRADE 9 LP as a fade factor (opposing UY1)
2. Keep 9 PY as strong fade (always signals endings)
3. Reframe backtest analysis: Garry's 9 LP win in 2025 was UY9 harmony, not trine override
4. Add "UY1 vs LP9 opposition" as a new scoring factor
