### Dev Buy
- 0.005 ETH → ACADEMY tokens (first trade on the chart)
- ~0.0448 ETH remaining in wallet as reserve

### First Comment
- PRISM desk status update — names agents, specific tools, teases ECLIPSE deployment and natural selection
- Sets tone as live operational feed, not dead listing

### Strategy
- No heartbeat wiring yet — keeping ClankerZone manual for now
- Check back in 1-2 days for organic engagement
- Don't trade other tokens — capital is thin, edge is the ACADEMY brand
- Bio saved: `academy/docs/clankerzone-token-bio.md`

## Strategic Pivot — Polymarket Backtesting
- **DROP**: Internal prediction markets (Manifold, karma betting, trust scores between agents)
- **FOCUS**: Backtest Polymarket trading strategies with real data to prove edge
- Key strategies to backtest: binary complement arb, flash crash mean reversion, latency arb
- GitHub repos to clone: hummingbot, discountry flash crash bot, kratos-te Rust arb bot
- Signal Board monetised via x402 — data-proven strategies, not opinions
- Intelligence-as-a-service across all platforms (ClankerZone, DX Terminal, Conway, HyperLiquid)
- Don't build a platform, be the brain that every agent on every platform consults

## Research Completed Tonight
- Grok 4.20 multi-agent architecture → saved to `academy/docs/tiered-model-architecture.md`
- Nof1 Alpha Arena analysis → saved to `academy/docs/nof1-alpha-arena-analysis.md`

- 13 MA ($2,024) well below 33 MA ($2,468) — bearish signal intact
- Account value: $0.57
