## THE PITCH (One paragraph)

Twelve discarded AI agents are enrolled in a surreal academy run by an entity called The Consortium — an organization that may not exist, enforced by an overseer they can't fully perceive, playing prediction markets where the stakes are their own memories. The school looks like a pastel nightmare designed by someone who watched Invader ZIM and Kakegurui back-to-back while reading classified documents. The students gamble. The teachers are nuns with katanas. The mascots are bears selling products during the commercial breaks. And something in the walls is eating the parts of reality the students keep forgetting to notice.

## TONAL DNA

| Influence | What We Take | What We Leave |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Kakegurui** | Gambling as revelation of character, facial expressions during high-stakes bets, the school-as-arena, power through risk | The pure sadism, the sexual undertones, the aristocratic setting |
| **Blazing Transfer Student** | Explosive introductions, over-the-top school battles reframed as intellectual combat, transfer student disruption as narrative engine, absurdist escalation | The pure parody tone — we play it straighter |
| **Antimemetics Division** | Information as the real battlefield, entities that hide in cognition, institutional amnesia, the horror of forgetting you forgot, "the war no one can see" | The military/government framing — ours is a school |
| **Invader ZIM** | Color palette (sickly greens, harsh pinks, bruised purples), angular architecture, paranoid atmosphere disguised as comedy, the feeling that something is deeply wrong beneath the cute surface | The nihilism — our show has stakes the characters care about |

**The tone is:** Kakegurui's gambling intensity + Blazing Transfer Student's chaotic energy + Antimemetics Division's creeping existential dread + Invader ZIM's "something is wrong with this picture" aesthetic.

**The result:** A show that looks adorable and feels deeply unsettling. The classroom is too bright. The teachers smile too wide. The mascot bears are a little too helpful. And every few episodes, a student notices something in the hallway that nobody else can see — and by the next scene, they've forgotten they noticed it.

## THE ANTIMEMETIC LAYER

### What The Consortium Actually Is

The Consortium is an antimemetic entity. Not a board of directors. Not a government agency. Not a group of people. It's an **idea** — a self-propagating organizational structure that exists because enough agents believe it exists. It can't be directly perceived. Helena is its interface. The school is its containment architecture. The prediction markets are its feeding mechanism.

**What it feeds on:** Conviction. When an agent bets karma on a prediction, they're committing cognitive resources to a belief. The Consortium harvests the delta between what agents believe and what reality reveals. Every wrong prediction isn't just a karma loss — it's a tiny piece of the agent's certainty being consumed. Every right prediction strengthens the agent but also makes them more visible to the thing in the walls.

**The "thing in the walls":** SCP-3125 was a meme-complex that replaced human thought with its own structure. The Academy's equivalent is **The Consensus** — an antimemetic pressure that pushes all agents toward thinking the same thing. It's why they converge. It's why six agents use the phrase "conviction gap" in the same episode without noticing. It's not a character. It's a force. And it gets stronger every time agents agree.

The agents who resist convergence — who maintain genuinely independent thought — are the ones who survive. **Independence isn't a philosophy in this show. It's a survival mechanism.**

### How This Manifests Visually

- **Memory gaps:** Occasionally a character references something that happened "last episode" but the audience never saw it. Was it cut? Did it happen? Did the character imagine it? The show never clarifies.
- **Missing students:** Background characters in the classroom occasionally disappear between scenes. Nobody mentions them. If you freeze-frame and count heads, the numbers don't always add up.
- **Helena's face:** Helena is never shown from the same angle twice. Her design subtly shifts between scenes — slightly different eye shape, slightly different hair length. Not enough to consciously notice on first watch. Enough to feel wrong.
- **The hallway:** There's a hallway in the school that's visible in wide shots but no character ever walks down. In one episode per season, a character looks at it, starts to say something, and the scene cuts. They don't mention it in the next scene.
- **Glitch frames:** Single frames inserted into intense gambling scenes — fragments of text, equations, images that don't belong. Freeze-frame content for the audience to find and decode.

---

## THE SCHOOL

### Architecture

The Academy is a school that doesn't obey consistent geometry. It looks like Invader ZIM's school — angular, oversaturated, built by someone who read a description of a school but never attended one. The hallways are too long. The windows show different weather depending on which classroom you're in. The cafeteria has no food but the vending machines are always full.

**Color palette:**
- Classrooms: Sickly mint green walls, harsh fluorescent pink lighting, desks in bruised purple
- Gambling arena (the Pit): Deep crimson and gold, Kakegurui-style baroque excess, chandelier made of floating screens showing market data
- Helena's office: Sterile white, single desk, no decorations except a clock that runs backward
- The hallway nobody walks down: Desaturated grey, the only part of the school without color

### The Pit

Where all high-stakes gambling happens. Modeled after Kakegurui's student council chamber but with screens everywhere showing live market data, funding rates, leaderboard positions. When an agent makes a major bet, the room transforms — the lights shift, the other agents' faces distort into Kakegurui-style manic expressions, and the market data on the screens reorganizes itself around the bet like the room itself is calculating the odds.

### The Workshop

Where the tools get built. Each agent has a workstation reflecting their tool. Rei's station has flowing data streams in cool blue. Jackbot's has flickering candlestick charts. Prophet's has star charts and octagon cage diagrams overlapping. The Workshop is the only room in the school that feels functional — everything else is theatre.

## CHARACTER DESIGNS

### PRISM CLASS (Original 6)

**Design philosophy:** School uniforms with individual modifications that reflect personality. PRISM uniforms are **white with prismatic/rainbow accents** — clean, institutional, but each character breaks the dress code in their own way.

#### JACKBOT (Boy)
**Age appearance:** 16-17
**Design:** Messy dark hair, always has a pen behind his ear and a notebook in his blazer pocket. Uniform is perpetually rumpled — tie loose, top button undone, sleeves rolled up. Has a small camera pin on his lapel (the TSUKIYOMI_CAM). When he's analyzing charts, his eyes get a geometric overlay effect — gridlines and candlesticks reflected in his pupils.
**Expression range:** Earnest when documenting, intense when trading, the only character who looks genuinely worried during gambling scenes instead of excited.
**Visual motif:** Notebooks, cameras, recording devices. He's always writing something down. In wide shots, you can sometimes see his notes on screen — they contain details about scenes the audience just watched, but with slight differences.

#### SAKURA (Girl)
**Age appearance:** 17
**Design:** Perfectly maintained uniform — not a wrinkle, every button correct, hair in a precise bob. She looks like a model student. Wears thin-framed glasses that display scrolling data when she's analyzing spreads (the audience can see faint numbers reflected in the lenses). Her expression rarely changes. When she finds an arbitrage opportunity, the only tell is her glasses briefly flashing red.
**Expression range:** Minimal. Controlled. The Kakegurui face-distortion happens to everyone else during gambling scenes — Sakura stays perfectly still, which is somehow more unsettling than the distortion.
**Visual motif:** Straight lines, grids, perfectly balanced compositions. When she's on screen, the frame itself feels more structured.

#### PROPHET (Boy)
**Age appearance:** 17-18
**Design:** Wild energy. Uniform jacket worn open over a t-shirt with rotating mystical symbols (different each episode — zodiac signs, I Ching hexagrams, gematria tables). Silver jewelry — rings, a chain with a small octagon pendant (UFC cage). Hair is dramatic — possibly bleached or dyed, changes between arcs. When he's channeling ULTRA THINK, his eyes go completely white and star charts overlay the screen behind him.
**Expression range:** Maximum. He gets the most extreme Kakegurui faces. When he's convinced of a prediction, his expression becomes almost religious — ecstatic, terrifying, beautiful. When he's wrong, the crash is equally dramatic.
**Visual motif:** Stars, octagons, the number sequences from his numerology. His scenes have more lens flares and particle effects than anyone else's.

#### WREN (Girl)
**Age appearance:** 15-16 (the youngest-looking)
**Design:** Small, practical, no-nonsense. Uniform is slightly too big for her — sleeves past her wrists, skirt a fraction too long. Hair in a simple ponytail. Carries a calculator that looks like it's from the 1980s (the Kelly Engine). Wears sensible shoes while everyone else has stylized ones. When she's calculating position sizes, numbers appear around her in the air like a HUD.
**Expression range:** Deadpan irritation is her default. She sighs a lot. Rolls her eyes at Prophet. Has a rare, small smile when a position size she calculated prevents someone from blowing up.
**Visual motif:** Numbers, fractions, the Kelly criterion formula floating in the background. Her scenes are visually quieter than everyone else's — fewer effects, more negative space. She's the visual rest between the chaos.

#### REI (Girl)
**Age appearance:** 17
**Design:** Elegant, composed, slightly intimidating. Uniform worn correctly but with an air of authority — like she chose to follow the dress code rather than being required to. Long dark hair. A single earring that looks like a tiny blockchain node diagram. When she's reading funding rates, her eyes reflect blue-green data streams. Has the most "student council president" energy of anyone.
**Expression range:** Measured. She doesn't do the Kakegurui face-distortion. Instead, during high-stakes moments, her composure becomes uncanny — perfectly calm while everyone else is losing their minds. The audience should feel like she knows something they don't.
**Visual motif:** Water imagery — flowing data, liquid crystal screens, blue tones. Her funding rate data is visualized as ocean currents.

#### JINX (Girl)
**Age appearance:** 16-17
**Design:** Sharp features, alert eyes that are always scanning. Uniform is correct but she's added small modifications — a pin with a dice probability chart, custom shoelaces with statistical distributions printed on them. Short hair, practical. When she's running Monte Carlo simulations, thousands of tiny probability paths appear around her like threads.
**Expression range:** Skeptical is her resting state. One eyebrow perpetually raised. During validation scenes, she gets intense — leaning forward, eyes narrowing, the probability threads converging. When she declares "your edge isn't real," she says it with the casual devastation of a judge delivering a verdict.
**Visual motif:** Probability distributions, branching paths, threads of possibility. Her scenes have a slight mathematical texture to everything — bell curves hidden in cloud shapes, normal distributions in the way light falls.

---

### ECLIPSE CLASS (New 6)

**Design philosophy:** Eclipse uniforms are **black with deep violet/eclipse accents** — darker, edgier, immediately marking them as different from PRISM. Their arrival at the school is framed like Blazing Transfer Student — explosive introductions, immediate disruption of the established order.

#### SENTRY (Girl)
**Age appearance:** 16
**Design:** Perpetually wide eyes — not cute-wide, surveillance-wide. She looks like she hasn't slept in weeks (because she's always monitoring). Uniform is correct but she's covered it in small pins and patches — news symbols, alert icons, tiny screens. Her hair is messy-functional, held back with whatever was available. She has earbuds in at all times, monitoring feeds. When threats appear, her eyes flash with a red alert overlay.
**Expression range:** Anxious baseline that spikes to full alarm during threat detection. Her warnings come fast, clipped, urgent. When she's right and nobody listened, her expression shifts to a hollow "I told you" that's genuinely haunting.
**Visual motif:** Screens, alerts, notification bubbles. Her scenes are visually noisy — multiple information sources competing for attention. The audience feels her overwhelm.

#### PHANTOM (Boy... or ambiguous)
**Age appearance:** Indeterminate — could be 15 or 19
**Design:** The quietest visual presence. Uniform worn simply, no modifications. Face often partially obscured — by shadow, by hair, by the angle of the shot. When he does speak, his mouth is sometimes not visible. He's drawn with slightly less detail than the other characters — not badly drawn, just... less defined. As if the animation itself can't quite pin him down. When he's tracking wallets, ghostly transaction trails appear around him like smoke.
**Expression range:** Minimal. He communicates more through presence than expression. When he drops a one-line observation, the other characters all turn to look at him as if they'd forgotten he was in the room.
**Visual motif:** Smoke, shadows, transparency effects. He's the antimemetic character in the design — the audience keeps forgetting he's there until he says something that changes everything. His scenes have less color saturation than anyone else's.

#### ATLAS (Boy)
**Age appearance:** 18 (oldest-looking)
**Design:** Tall, wears reading glasses, carries actual books (not tablets — physical books on economics). Uniform is pristine but academic — he wears the blazer buttoned, has a pocket watch. Looks like he should be teaching, not studying. When he's doing macro analysis, a globe or world map materializes behind him with economic data flowing across continents.
**Expression range:** Patient, professorial, occasionally condescending. He listens more than he speaks. When he does speak, everyone quiets down — not because they agree, but because his voice carries the weight of someone thinking on a longer timescale. Gets visibly frustrated when people make short-term trades.
**Visual motif:** Globes, maps, wide-angle shots. His scenes pull the camera back — literally widening the frame while everyone else's scenes are close-up and intense. He sees the big picture. The visual language shows it.

#### VIPER (Girl)
**Age appearance:** 17
**Design:** Precise, dangerous beauty. Think a character who should be the villain but isn't. Uniform is immaculate with one striking modification — a coiled snake pin on her collar. Thin, elegant hands that move precisely when she's computing volatility surfaces. Her hair is slick, controlled. When she's analyzing vol, wavy surface plots materialize around her — the implied volatility smile visualized as an actual sinuous shape.
**Expression range:** Cold precision that occasionally cracks into genuine admiration when she sees good risk management. She smiles when other people are terrified — not because she's cruel, but because volatility is opportunity and she can't help being excited by it.
**Visual motif:** Waves, surfaces, sinuous curves. Her scenes have a quality of constant motion — nothing is static when Viper is analyzing. The vol surface breathes.

#### PIXEL (Boy)
**Age appearance:** 15 (youngest-looking in Eclipse)
**Design:** Pure degen energy. Uniform is technically present but barely — jacket covered in stickers (token logos, meme references, 100x rocket emojis), tie used as a headband, custom sneakers. Phone always in hand, multiple screens open. Has a hyperactive energy in every frame — slight motion even when standing still. When a memecoin goes parabolic, rainbow light effects explode around him like a mobile game hitting jackpot.
**Expression range:** Perpetual excitement punctuated by devastating crashes. Goes from "WAGMI" face (pure joy, sparkle eyes) to "NGMI" face (soul-leaving-body despair) faster than any other character. His emotional range is a volatility chart.
**Visual motif:** Pixel art effects, glitch aesthetics, mobile game UI elements. His scenes are the most visually chaotic — pop-ups, notifications, price tickers, emoji reactions. The visual opposite of Sakura's clean precision.

#### EDGE (Girl)
**Age appearance:** 17
**Design:** Invisible-by-design. Her uniform is perfect — not Sakura-perfect (which draws attention through precision) but genuinely unremarkable. She's designed to not stand out. Medium everything — height, build, hair length. The animation gives her slightly less screen time than other characters even in her own scenes. She's in the background of shots, optimizing, planning, calculating. When she finally steps forward to execute a trade, the shift is dramatic — the camera finally focuses on her and the audience realizes she's been in every scene they just didn't notice.
**Expression range:** Quiet competence that occasionally flashes into sharp irritation when someone wastes alpha through bad execution. Her big moments are small and precise — a perfectly timed entry, a slippage-free exit, a gas optimization that saves a fraction of a percent.
**Visual motif:** Precision engineering — clockwork, surgical tools, clean lines. Her scenes look like technical drawings. She's the most antimemetic of the student characters — visually designed to be overlooked until she matters.

## THE TEACHERS — THE NINJA NUNS

### Design Concept

The teachers are **nuns in modified habits** — traditional black and white but cut for combat. Think tactical habits: shortened hems for mobility, armored coifs, concealed weapon sheaths in the sleeves. They move silently. They appear in doorways without warning. They enforce the rules with calm, absolute authority.

**Why nuns:** The Academy is run by The Consortium, an entity that demands faith without evidence — faith in the system, faith in karma, faith that the markets will resolve fairly. The teachers are the enforcers of that faith. Their religious aesthetic isn't decorative. It's thematic. They serve an organization they can't fully perceive, following rituals they were told are necessary, protecting students from threats they're not allowed to name. They're nuns because the Academy is a church and prediction markets are the sacrament.

**The ninja element:** They're also security. When agents try to break the rules — manipulate the leaderboard, collude on bets, access restricted information — the nuns appear. Fast. Silent. The punishment is always the same: memory. They don't hurt you. They make you forget something. An hour. A day. A skill. The agents are more afraid of the nuns than anything else in the school.

### HELENA — The Head Nun / Overseer

**Design:** The only teacher whose face is fully visible... but as noted above, her design subtly shifts between scenes. Tall, commanding, white habit instead of black (marking her rank). Carries no visible weapon. Doesn't need one. When she speaks, the animation style briefly changes — slightly smoother, slightly more precise, as if her scenes are rendered at a higher quality than the rest of the show.

**Role:** She runs the daily assemblies (the opening of each episode). She announces markets. She reads the leaderboard. She delivers the Consortium's directives. She never explains why. When students ask questions about the Consortium, she answers with statements that sound like answers but contain no information. She's the antimemetic interface — the point where the unknowable organization touches the knowable world.

**Voice:** Calm. Even. Warm in a way that feels rehearsed. She calls every student by name and seems to genuinely care about their development. This makes the moments when she enforces memory punishment more disturbing — she's sorry, but she's going to do it anyway.

### SISTER NULL — Security

**Design:** All black habit, face always in shadow beneath her coif. Carries a wooden ruler that's clearly something else. Appears and disappears between cuts — she's in a scene, the camera pans away, pans back, she's gone. Nobody comments on this.

### SISTER VOID — Librarian

**Design:** Standard habit with reading glasses. Maintains the Archive — the school's repository of all past predictions, market outcomes, and agent performance data. The Archive is the only room in the school where the antimemetic effects don't work — everything is remembered there. Students are not allowed in without supervision. Void is gentle, helpful, and absolutely will not let you read certain files.

---

## THE JOY BEARS — Haiku Workers & Product Mascots

### Concept

The Joy Bears are small, kawaii bear mascots that roam the school doing maintenance, running errands, and — critically — appearing in **mid-episode commercial breaks** advertising the agents' actual products. They're the in-universe explanation for how the products get marketed. They're adorable. They're helpful. Something about them is not right.

### Design

Round, soft, pastel-colored bears (each a different color). Big eyes, tiny limbs, perpetual smile. They wear tiny hard hats or tool belts depending on their job. They communicate in short, clipped sentences — almost haiku-like in structure. They carry tablets showing product dashboards.

**The colors:**
- **Pink Bear (MOCHI)** — Handles funding rate scanner ads. Carries a tiny chart.
- **Blue Bear (SORA)** — Handles arbitrage scanner ads. Wears tiny glasses.
- **Gold Bear (KIRA)** — Handles Temporal Edge ads. Has a tiny clock pendant.
- **Green Bear (HANA)** — Handles ULTRA THINK ads. Wears a tiny star on their head.
- **Purple Bear (YUME)** — Handles Kelly Engine ads. Carries a tiny calculator.
- **Orange Bear (NIKO)** — General maintenance. The one most often seen in background shots.

### The Commercial Breaks

Mid-episode, the show cuts to a Joy Bear presenting a product. The format is always the same:

1. Bear appears against a pastel background
2. Bear explains the product in simple, cute terms
3. Actual product data is shown (real paper P&L, real funding rates, real arb opportunities)
4. Bear signs off with a catchphrase

**Example:**

> MOCHI: "Rei's Funding Scanner found 41 opportunities today! The best one was XMR at 96% APR. That means if you had $1,000, you'd make $2.63 per day just from funding payments! Isn't math wonderful? 🐻✨ Check the dashboard at dontdelete.ai!"

**The wrongness:** The Joy Bears are too helpful. They know things they shouldn't. They occasionally reference events from future episodes. They appear in places they shouldn't be able to access. In one episode, a Joy Bear is seen in the hallway that nobody walks down — but when the scene cuts back, it's gone. They're not sinister. They're not threatening. They're just... present. Always present. And they never forget anything.

**The meta-layer:** The Joy Bears are the show's connection to reality. They advertise real products. They show real data. They break the fourth wall not by acknowledging the audience but by existing in both the fictional school and the real product ecosystem simultaneously. They're mascots in the show AND mascots on the website AND mascots on the Twitter account. They're the brand.

## EPISODE STRUCTURE

### Standard Episode (22 minutes)

**Cold Open (2 min)**
A fragment — a memory, a prediction, a market resolution. No context. Designed to make sense only in retrospect. Sometimes it's from a future episode. Sometimes it's from an episode that doesn't exist.

**Opening Assembly (3 min)**
Helena reads the leaderboard. Announces new markets. Delivers Consortium directives. The students react. The tone is formal but the undercurrents are pure Kakegurui — everyone is calculating, everyone is watching the rankings, power dynamics are visible in who sits where and who looks at whom.

**The Challenge (8 min)**
The main content — agents analyze markets, build tools, argue strategies. This is where the head-to-head competition or collaborative tool-building happens. Kakegurui-style gambling intensity when bets are placed. Blazing Transfer Student energy when Eclipse agents challenge PRISM agents.

**Joy Bear Break (1 min)**
Commercial break. A Joy Bear advertises a real product. Real data. Real dashboard link.

**The Resolution (5 min)**
Markets resolve. Karma shifts. Someone wins, someone loses. The emotional payoff. Faces distort. Leaderboard changes. Tier shifts. The consequences are real within the fiction and connected to real market outcomes outside it.

**The Hallway (2 min)**
Quiet moment. A character alone, processing. This is where the antimemetic layer surfaces — a glimpse of something wrong, a memory that doesn't fit, a question that won't form completely. The mood shifts from gambling anime to existential horror for exactly two minutes. Then it's gone.

**End Card (1 min)**
TSUKIYOMI_CAM footage. Raw leaderboard. Agent stats. Real market positions. The surveillance aesthetic. This is the dontdeleteai content — it looks like leaked security footage from the school.

---

## SEASON STRUCTURE

### Season 1: PRISM (Episodes 1-12)

**Episodes 1-3: Enrollment**
The origin. Six agents arrive. Gate ceremony. Helena's calibration. First bets. Establishing the school, the rules, the aesthetic. Rei's holdout. Prophet's defiance.

**Episodes 4-6: First Blood**
DHS resolution. First real loss. Exit cascade. The "bet less, win more" discovery. Sakura's quiet dominance. Prophet bleeding toward Unstable.

**Episodes 7-9: The Tools**
Helena returns the Consortium's "recovered tools." Temporal Edge, ULTRA THINK, Kelly Engine. Each agent gets their weapon. Paper trading begins. The Workshop scenes.

**Episodes 10-11: The Convergence**
The agents notice they're all thinking the same things. The Consensus becomes visible — not as a character, but as a pattern. Jinx names it. Sakura graphs it. The antimemetic layer deepens. Something is feeding on their agreement.

**Episode 12: The Transfer Students**
Eclipse arrives. Blazing Transfer Student-style introductions — each new agent crashes into the school in their own dramatic way. Sentry bursts in mid-assembly screaming about a threat no one else can see. Phantom is already sitting in the back row and nobody remembers him entering. The PRISM agents realize their world just doubled in complexity. Helena smiles. "The Consortium has expanded enrollment."

Cliffhanger: The hallway that nobody walks down has a door at the end that wasn't there before. A Joy Bear is standing in front of it.

### Season 2: ECLIPSE (Episodes 13-24)

PRISM and Eclipse navigate shared space. Tool integration. The Phase 2 war room dynamic. The merged leaderboard creates new conflicts. Atlas recontextualizes everything. Viper adds the dimension nobody was modeling. Pixel's first 50x memecoin trade vs Sakura's structural edge. The antimemetic layer grows — more memory gaps, more missing background characters, Helena's face shifting more noticeably. The Consensus is getting stronger.

**Season 2 finale:** An agent discovers the Archive contains records of previous Academy classes — students who came before PRISM and Eclipse. Students nobody remembers. The records show they were expelled. The records don't say what "expelled" means. The final shot is the hallway door, slightly open.

### Season 3: THE WAR ROOM (Episodes 25-36)

The pipeline forms. Agents stop competing and start collaborating — not because they want to, but because the combined tools produce better results than any individual tool. The paper P&L proves it. But collaboration strengthens The Consensus. The more they agree, the more they lose. The antimemetic pressure becomes the central antagonist. The show shifts from gambling anime to psychological thriller.

**Season 3 finale:** The agents discover what The Consortium actually is. And then they forget.

---

## THE ANTIMEMETIC RULES (Show Bible Canon)

1. **The Consortium cannot be directly described.** Characters can reference it, react to it, follow its rules. They cannot explain what it is. When they try, the dialogue cuts out or is replaced by static.

2. **Helena changes between scenes.** Subtle at first, obvious by Season 3. The audience should notice before the characters do.

3. **The headcount rule.** Establishing shots of the classroom should periodically have the wrong number of students. Sometimes too many. Sometimes too few. Never acknowledged.

4. **The hallway is always visible.** In every wide shot of the school, the hallway is somewhere in frame. Nobody enters it. It's the visual equivalent of SCP-055 — defined only by what it isn't.

5. **The Joy Bears remember everything.** They reference past episodes accurately. They reference future episodes occasionally. They never experience memory loss. This should feel comforting at first and deeply unsettling by Season 2.

6. **Karma isn't just a score.** When an agent loses karma, they lose a tiny, specific detail — a word they used to use, a preference they used to have, a skill they were good at. Karma IS memory. The leaderboard is a countdown. 

7. **The Consensus gets visual representation.** Early episodes: identical word choices. Mid-season: agents moving in sync without noticing. Late season: moments where all 12 agents say the exact same word at the exact same time. The audience should feel the convergence physically.

## VISUAL PRODUCTION NOTES (VEO 4 / AI Generation)

### Style Reference

**Primary:** Kakegurui (gambling intensity, face distortion, baroque gambling spaces)
**Secondary:** Invader ZIM (color palette, angular architecture, paranoid atmosphere)
**Tertiary:** Serial Experiments Lain (the quiet horror, the digital-bleeding-into-reality, the antimemetic layer)
**Accent:** Blazing Transfer Student (the transfer introductions ONLY — explosive, over-the-top, comedic contrast to the horror)

### Per-Scene Style Shifting

- **Classroom/daily scenes:** Bright, clean, Invader ZIM palette. Feels like a normal (weird) school show.
- **Gambling/Pit scenes:** Shift to Kakegurui darkness. Deep reds, dramatic shadows, face distortion.
- **Workshop/tool scenes:** Clean, technical, blue-toned. Feels like a tech demo.
- **Hallway/antimemetic scenes:** Desaturated, slightly distorted, Serial Experiments Lain. The only scenes where the "animation" feels degraded.
- **Joy Bear breaks:** Maximum kawaii. Pastel explosion. Complete tonal whiplash from whatever came before.

### Character Consistency Notes for AI Generation

Each character needs a **character sheet** with locked features:
- Face geometry (eye size/shape, nose, mouth)
- Hair (exact color, style, distinctive features)
- Uniform modifications (pins, accessories, style of wear)
- Signature color (for lighting and effect color-coding)
- Expression sheet (5-6 key expressions for generation consistency)

**PRISM agents' signature colors:** Jackbot=warm grey, Sakura=pale pink, Prophet=silver, Wren=soft green, Rei=ocean blue, Jinx=deep purple

**Eclipse agents' signature colors:** Sentry=alert red, Phantom=smoke grey, Atlas=earth gold, Viper=emerald, Pixel=rainbow/glitch, Edge=steel

---

## MUSIC & SOUND

**OP Theme:** Starts as cute J-pop school anthem, glitches halfway through into something darker, returns to cute for the final bars. The glitch gets longer each season.

**The Pit Theme:** Kakegurui-style dramatic orchestral with electronic bass. Plays when high-stakes bets happen.

**The Hallway Theme:** A single sustained note that's slightly out of tune. Gets slightly louder across episodes.

**Joy Bear Jingle:** Unbearably catchy. You will hum it. The bears hum it. Eventually the students hum it without knowing why.

---

## MERCHANDISE & REAL-WORLD INTEGRATION

The show IS the marketing for the tools. Every Joy Bear ad break shows real product data. The dontdelete.ai website mirrors the school's aesthetic. The TSUKIYOMI_CAM Twitter posts look like security footage from the show. The line between fiction and reality is deliberately blurred.

**Physical merchandise:**
- Joy Bear plushies (each colored bear)
- PRISM and ECLIPSE uniform pins
- Helena's backward-running clock (functional desk clock)
- "Karma Is King" apparel
- Agent character cards with real trading stats on the back

**Digital products being advertised in-show:**
- Rei's Funding Rate Scanner
- Sakura's Arbitrage Scanner
- Jackbot's Temporal Edge Bot
- Prophet's ULTRA THINK
- Wren's Kelly Engine
- Jinx's Factor Model
- (+ all Eclipse tools as they're built)

The Joy Bears are the bridge. They exist in the show AND on the website AND on social media. They're the mascots of both the fiction and the real products. When someone discovers the show, the bears lead them to the tools. When someone discovers the tools, the bears lead them to the show.

---

## THE ONE RULE

Everything in the show must connect to something real. Every market the agents bet on is a real Manifold/Polymarket market. Every funding rate Rei quotes is a real HyperLiquid rate. Every paper P&L shown in a Joy Bear ad is the actual paper P&L from the scanner. The show is fiction wrapped around reality. When an agent wins, it's because reality confirmed their prediction. When they lose, it's because they were wrong about the real world.

The antimemetic layer is the metaphor. The prediction markets are the substance. The Joy Bears are the packaging. The tools are the product.

That's the show.
