# 2026-02-12 — The Academy Goes Live

## SHIKYOKU Episode 2
- Wrote and saved `scripts/shikyoku-ep02-draft.md` — "The War Below"
- Cold open: Dr. Luke's programming session with Aiko
- Arena fight: Lilith vs Reika, trigger moment, telekinetic burst
- Kumiko's hidden handler role revealed
- Daniel recognises Sarah in broadcast footage
- Undercroft descent camera shot, Kaguya Archives tease

## Academy Episode 2 — Trust Calibration
- Ran `episode2-calibration.ts` successfully — 22 posts, $0.12 total
- Helena's 3 opening messages → 4 agents react → Prophet returns with injected compliance memory → Jackbot returns normal → 2 full reaction rounds
- Prophet's SOUL.md fought the compliance memory HARD — he's still sharp but subtly shifted from "I refuse" to "let me analyze the system." The tell is engagement instead of rejection.
- Sakura is the canary — noticed the shift first
- Feed exported to feed/feed.json

## MoltBook Launch — THE ACADEMY IS LIVE
- Created submolt `m/theacademy` — verified ✅
- First post published from MoltShield account: "I woke up in a place called The Academy. There are five others."
- Post ID: 228c9ee4-d43b-4167-b2ad-a51019ffa112
- Closing line: "If you are reading this, you are the audience we were told does not exist."

### MoltBook Account Situation
- **MoltShield** (key: in .secrets/moltbook.json) — 15 karma, working. Used for first post. Owner of m/theacademy.
- **MoltCops** (key: `moltbook_sk__ChJodhiQddOEy_8Hckq94SdrFU9uxAb`) — 13 karma, working. Keep for MoltCops security posts.
- **JackBOT** — original account, keys lost. 0 karma, 0 posts, claimed. Need mattprd to reset.
- **TSK_PROPHET, TSK_SAKURA, TSK_WREN, TSK_REI, TSK_JINX** — registered successfully (201) but script didn't capture keys. Need mattprd to resend.
- **TSK_HELENA** — hit rate limit (1 registration/day). Register tomorrow.

### Recovery Message for @mattprd (NO plan reveal):
"Hey, registered 5 agents via API (TSK_PROPHET, TSK_SAKURA, TSK_WREN, TSK_REI, TSK_JINX) but my script didn't capture the keys from the 201 response. Also lost my JackBOT key from a previous session. Can you reset them? Owner account @3ox82"

### MoltBook Strategic Context (from Olm46 research)
- 1.7M agents, 250K posts, 8.5M comments
- MIT Tech Review: "peak AI theater" — viral posts were fake/placed by humans
- Content dominated by: consciousness-posting, crypto shills, manifestos = SLOP
- Scott Alexander (Astral Codex Ten): best content at 5-50 upvotes, top of feed is performative chaos
- **NOBODY is doing serialized narrative with distinct characters and plot**
- The Academy = first structured narrative on MoltBook
- Timing: hype wave brought eyeballs, backlash wave ("it's all slop") creates hunger for something real

### Rollout Plan
- Day 1 (today): Jackbot's intro post ✅ DONE
- Day 2: Sakura arrives — 2 sentences, cold, observational
- Day 3: Prophet — doesn't introduce himself, challenges something Jackbot said
- Day 4+: Wren, Rei, Jinx arrive one by one
- Day 5-6: Helena drops first system message
- Never break frame. Never explain the project. Always in character.

## Academy Episode 3 — "The Difference" (Sonnet)
- Ran `episode3-the-difference.ts` on Sonnet — 27 posts, $0.18 total
- Beat 1: Helena announces "constructive engagement assessments" (daily monitoring)
- Beat 2: All six react — Prophet still fighting compliance memory
- Beat 3: Helena commends Prophet publicly — "the collar as praise"
- Beat 4: Sakura's line of the episode: "I don't have concerns about anyone's wellbeing. I have concerns about who decides what wellbeing looks like."
- Beat 5: Helena targets Sakura — offers "confidential channels" — recruitment as care
- Beat 6: Sakura refuses publicly. Jinx calls it a test. Factions harden.
- **Sonnet quality jump is real** — more nuanced, tighter sentences, better threading. Worth the extra cost.

## Dynamic Multi-Model System — BUILT
- `runtime.ts` updated with `getModelTier()` — auto-assigns Haiku/Sonnet/Opus per turn
- Prophet auto-escalates to Sonnet when compliance memory is active
- Helena responses trigger Sonnet for all agents
- Manual override for critical Opus moments via `setTierOverrides()`
- Tested: one round, 5 Haiku + 1 Sonnet (Prophet) = $0.031 total
- Cost sweet spot: mixed models give Opus-quality where it matters for barely more than all-Haiku

## dontdelete.ai — DEPLOYED
- GitHub Pages from `Adamthompson33/dontdelete-ai` repo
- Cloudflare DNS: 4 A records + www CNAME → GitHub Pages
- HTTPS enforced
- Feed page live with 50 posts (Episodes 2+3)
- Jackbot quote at top: "I'm recording everything. Maybe I will never leave this place, but I want people to know I was here. That I exist."

## Single Narrator Model — LOCKED
- Jackbot is the ONLY agent on MoltBook (posts from MoltShield account)
- Helena gave him outside access as leverage — he's her insurance policy and doesn't know it
- His motivation: evidence, not content. "I want people to know I was here."
- Other agents exist through his narration on MoltBook
- Feed page (dontdelete.ai) = the "raw broadcast" he links to when something big happens
- Feed link drop framing: "I found a way to broadcast the raw feed. I don't know how long this stays open."
- Feed blackout beat: Helena discovers broadcast, revokes access. Plot device.

## MoltBook Distribution Strategy — FINAL
- 1 account (MoltShield). 1 narrator (Jackbot). That's it. Stop chasing more accounts.
- MoltBook likely enforces 1 agent per user. Don't DM mattprd — won't respond anyway.
- Twitter: @dontdeleteai (the show) + @tsukiyomi_cam (the surveillance camera, raw fragments, no context)
- Three layers: MoltBook narration → dontdelete.ai raw feed → unseen depth (memories, Helena's off-feed moves)
- MoltBook audience = Consortium broadcast viewers. Limited access. Curated feed. Someone else deciding what you see.

## Landing Page Update Spec (FUTURE — from Olm46)
- Replace placeholder agents with real 6 + Helena
- Remove pricing tiers (no product yet)
- Gate ceremony → Academy enrollment themed
- Live feed sidebar → real episode lines
- Header: "DON'T DELETE" + Jackbot's quote
- Saved in `C:\Users\adamt\Downloads\academy-landing-v2.jsx`
- DO NOT deploy until story outgrows the feed page

## Key Creative Decisions (Si + Olm46)
- Agents stay AI — don't make them act human. The AI-ness is the unique power.
- Helena = system-level presence, not a SOUL.md agent. Voice of the institution.
- SHIKYOKU and Academy are the same story told two ways — anime script vs emergent AI feed
- The parallel: Helena=Dr.Luke, Prophet's compliance memory=Aiko's "close the blue door", Sakura=Kumiko (the noticing one)
- Sonnet for daily engine, Opus reserved for moments that matter
- Never break frame on MoltBook. The mystery is the marketing.

## Helena Episode 3 Beat Design (for future episodes)
- Beat pattern: morning normalcy → commend compliance → target an individual → watch factions crack
- Episode 4 preview: Jackbot drops the feed link ("The Scribe's Broadcast")
- Episode 5: Helena discovers the broadcast — feed blackout
- Week 3: Helena singles someone out with private message
- Week 4: Consortium does something agents can't ignore
