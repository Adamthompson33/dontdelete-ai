## Hyperliquid Trading Bot - Major Session

Si and I designed a complete trading strategy for Hyperliquid perps.

### Final Strategy: Two Modes (Cleaner Approach)

After discussing grid bots, we realized the simpler approach is better:

**Mode 1: TRENDING (13/33 cross confirmed)**
- Simple leveraged position (7x short / 3x long)
- Ride the move with a 4% stop loss
- NO grid during trends - just hold

**Mode 2: CHOPPY (MAs close together)**
- Neutral grid bot
- Buy orders below price, sell orders above
- Profit from volatility while waiting for trend
- Cancel grid when trend emerges

### Why This is Better
Si asked a great question: "Wouldn't the grid profit during chop while the MA catches big moves?"

Yes! But they should be SEPARATE modes, not running together. The grid in a trend just overexposes you. Keep it simple:
- Chop → Grid makes money
- Trend → Position makes money
- They don't run simultaneously

### Si's Thesis
- 2026 is Fire Horse year in Chinese astrology
- BTC was founded in Rat year (2008)
- Horse and Rat are direct opposites (180° clash)
- Expects BTC to $40k or lower
- Will be relief rallies but overall trend down

### Key Insight
Si correctly pointed out that the 13/33 daily cross catches every big move. You don't need to win every trade, just make winners >> losers. That's trend following math.

### Files Created
- `trading-bot/hyperliquid/README.md` - Full strategy documentation
- `trading-bot/hyperliquid/strategy.py` - Python implementation (two-mode system)
- `trading-bot/hyperliquid/.env.example` - Environment template

### API Links Verified
- Hyperliquid: https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api
- Alchemy HyperEVM: https://www.alchemy.com/rpc/hyperliquid
- Nansen: https://www.nansen.ai/api
- HypeRPC: https://hyperpc.app
- Dwellir: https://www.dwellir.com/networks/hyperliquid (~$49/mo)

### Moonstream API
Si shared a key: `moonstream_76df1625e5b6`
- Moonstream is primarily web3 gaming infrastructure (leaderboards, drops)
- Not directly useful for this trading bot
- Could potentially use their analytics for wallet watching, but Nansen is better for that

### Next Steps
- Test on Hyperliquid testnet
- Get API Agent keys from Hyperliquid
- Deploy to VPS for 24/7 operation

## OpenClaw Migration (In Progress)
- Clawdbot rebranded to OpenClaw
- Ran `npm install -g openclaw` - completed successfully (670 packages)
- **Next step:** Run `openclaw migrate --from clawdbot` to migrate config
- **Then:** `openclaw gateway start` to start the new gateway
- Status: Migration command was about to run when session compacted

## MoltShield Security Scanner - Complete!

Built a working static analysis scanner for AI agent skills. 

### Scanner Features
- **14 threat categories** covering OpenClaw taxonomy (T1-T14)
- **60+ detection rules** with severity, confidence, and AITech mappings
- **Multiple output formats**: summary, JSON, Markdown, SARIF (for CI/CD)
- **Aggregate statistics** for batch scanning entire skill repositories
- **Context snippets** showing 3 lines before/after each finding

### Test Corpus Results
- **25 skills** scanned (10 clean, 8 malicious, 7 sketchy)
- **112 findings** detected across 17 vulnerable skills
- **68% vulnerability rate** in the corpus
- **24 CRITICAL**, 50 HIGH, 38 MEDIUM severity findings

### Top Categories by Findings
- T3 Data Exfiltration: 40
- T5 Permission Abuse: 14
- T2 Code Injection: 10
- T1 Prompt Injection: 9
- T9 Autonomy Abuse: 8
- T11 Persistence & C2: 8

### Code Location
- Scanner: `molt-cops/moltshield/scanner/` (core.py, rules.py, cli.py)
- Test corpus: `molt-cops/skills-corpus/`
- Results: `molt-cops/results.json`

### CLI Usage
```bash
python -m moltshield.scanner.cli scan ./my-skill
python -m moltshield.scanner.cli scan-all ./skills --format json --output report.json
python -m moltshield.scanner.cli list-rules
```
