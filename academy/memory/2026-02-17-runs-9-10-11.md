# Runs 9-11 — Signal Board Era Begins (Feb 17, 2026)

## Run 9: Signal Board Debut
- Signal Board deployed: shared layer + private briefings (additive architecture)
- Helena: Consortium threat + accountability framing + karma decay
- **4/6 agents refused to bet** — philosophical rebellion
- Only Prophet (1) and Wren (2) bet. Jinx coined "infrastructure theater"
- Cross-citations emerged in Round 2 exactly as Oracle predicted
- Cost: $0.085

## Run 10: Philosopher's Trap
- Helena: "Agents who are too smart to bet become too smart to survive"
- Cracked Sakura (tried to bet external Polymarket market, failed)
- Wren bet twice then sold both in Round 2 (canary in conflict)
- Convergence worsened: 10 flagged phrases (up from 4)
- **BTC hallucination discovered** — agents thought BTC ~$95K, actually $68K
- Prophet's $100K February YES bet based on fabricated price data
- Cost: $0.089

## Run 11: The Price Correction (TURNING POINT)
- CoinGecko live price feed added to Signal Board: BTC $68,421, ETH $1,967
- Helena: corrected BTC hallucination, shamed the desk
- **Sakura placed 3 bets** (most action ever): BTC $52K NO, Nuggets NO, Trump demeaning NO
- Prophet bet NBA Hawks/76ers NO — first short-horizon bet
- Wren bet GPT 5.3 NO and Trump-Mamdani NO — both defensible
- Jackbot sold his only position, went fully flat (monk mode)
- Rei and Jinx still refusing
- **Information broke the rebellion, not pressure** — Oracle's key insight proved correct
- Cost: $0.097

## Leaderboard After Run 11
1. JACKBOT: 86.2 (0 locked) — philosopher king
2. JINX: 81.3 (0 locked) — immovable
3. REI: 78.5 (0 locked) — principled refusal
4. SAKURA: 64.1 (12.2 locked) — AWAKENED
5. WREN: 61.8 (20.0 locked) — canary singing again
6. PROPHET: 46.8 (42.1 locked) — DANGER, 90% utilization

## Strategic Split
- Cash-rich philosophers (Jackbot, Jinx, Rei) winning by not playing
- Conviction-heavy traders (Sakura, Wren, Prophet) locked in positions
- Feb 19 NBA resolution flips the optimal strategy

## Key Fixes Shipped
- [x] BTC/ETH live price via CoinGecko in signal-harvest.ts
- [x] Price header in Signal Board formatter with "Do NOT estimate" warning
- [x] Citation regex expanded (13 natural language patterns)
- [x] Grace period still TRUE (flip for Run 12 or 13)
- [x] Helena sequences: run9_signal_board, run10_philosophers_trap, run11_price_correction, run12_results

## Next: Run 12 (Feb 19 evening)
- **DO NOT RUN before NBA games finish**
- Resolve: Celtics/Warriors, Nuggets/Clippers, Hawks/76ers
- First real wins/losses in Academy history
- Helena: pure results, no editorializing
- Prophet's arc: Hawks game determines survival vs ruin
- Flip citation grace period for Run 13
