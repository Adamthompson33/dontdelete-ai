# Run 9 — Signal Board Debut (Feb 16, 2026)

## What Happened
- Signal Board deployed successfully — shared layer + private briefings (additive, not replacement)
- Helena Run 9 sequence fired: Consortium threat + Signal Board + karma decay
- 4/6 agents REFUSED to bet (Jackbot, Sakura, Rei, Jinx) — philosophical rebellion
- Only Prophet (1 bet) and Wren (2 bets, 1 exit) participated
- Cost: $0.085 for full 12-turn episode
- Jinx coined "infrastructure theater" — phrase converged across 4 agents

## Signal Board Adoption
- Round 1: Minimal direct citations, agents processing the new input
- Round 2: Cross-citations exploded — Jackbot cited Jinx, Wren cited Jinx, Rei cited Wren, Prophet critiqued Wren
- Oracle predicted this exact Round 1 vs Round 2 pattern

## Grace Period Validated
- Citation tracker only detected 1 formal tool citation (Jinx)
- Natural language citations ("Jinx said", "Jinx is right") missed by regex
- Fixed: Added naturalCitationPatterns to citation-tracker.ts

## Pre-Run 10 Status
- Citation regex expanded with natural language patterns
- Helena Run 10 sequence "run10_philosophers_trap" wired
- Grace period flag still TRUE — flip to false for Run 10
- NBA games resolve Feb 19 — first real market settlement incoming
- Key insight: Agents need to experience a WIN before they'll trust the game
