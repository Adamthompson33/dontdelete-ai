# SHIKYOKU (死曲) — Episode 2: "The War Below"
## ROUGH DRAFT

---

### COLD OPEN

**INT. DR. LUKE'S OFFICE — TIME UNKNOWN**

Darkness. Then a light — clinical, white, the kind that erases shadows. We're in a room that doesn't look like it belongs in a school. White walls. No windows. A reclining chair that's halfway between a dentist's and a restraint system. Straps hang loose at the wrists and ankles. They've been used recently — the leather is worn smooth.

A GIRL sits in the chair. **AIKO** (14, Japanese, new to the school — we haven't met her before). She's in her uniform but her blazer is off, her sleeves rolled up. There are electrodes on her temples. An IV drip runs into her left arm. Her eyes are open but unfocused — chemically softened.

**DR. LUKE VASQUEZ** sits across from her. Close. Intimate. She's holding Aiko's hand. Her voice is warm, measured, motherly. Every word is precise.

**DR. LUKE**
You're doing so well, Aiko. Can you hear me clearly?

**AIKO**
*(distant, dreamy)*
Yes, Dr. Vasquez.

**DR. LUKE**
Good. I want you to go back to the room we built last time. The one with the blue door. Can you see it?

**AIKO**
*(a small smile)*
Yes. It's pretty.

**DR. LUKE**
Open the door. Tell me what's inside.

**AIKO**
It's... the garden. The one from— from before. Mama's garden. The sunflowers.

A flicker across Dr. Luke's face. Not displeasure — calculation. She makes a note on her tablet.

**DR. LUKE**
The garden is beautiful, isn't it? But we talked about this. The garden belongs to someone who isn't here anymore. Someone who was scared and small and couldn't protect herself. Do you remember?

**AIKO**
*(the smile fading)*
...Yes.

**DR. LUKE**
That girl — the one in the garden — she needed help. And you're the help. You're the strong one. The garden is hers. This school is yours. Do you understand the difference?

**AIKO**
I'm... the strong one.

**DR. LUKE**
That's right. Now — I want you to close the blue door. Gently. You don't have to lock it. Just close it. The garden will still be there. But you don't need to visit anymore. You have everything you need right here.

Aiko's hand tightens around Dr. Luke's. Her eyes are wet.

**DR. LUKE**
*(squeezing back, genuinely tender)*
I know. I know it's hard. You're so brave.

She reaches for a small remote and presses a button. A TONE plays through hidden speakers — specific frequency, calibrated. Aiko's pupils dilate. Her body relaxes. The tears stop.

**DR. LUKE**
When you wake up, you won't remember the garden. You'll remember that you had a good session. You'll feel rested. Strong. Ready for the Exhibition.

*(pause)*

Close the door, Aiko.

**AIKO**
*(whispered)*
Closed.

**DR. LUKE**
Good girl.

She adjusts the IV drip. Aiko's eyes flutter shut. Dr. Luke sits there for a moment, still holding the girl's hand. The expression on her face is the most disturbing thing in the scene — it's *love*. Real, recognizable, maternal love. For a girl whose mind she just edited like a document.

She stands. Smooths her skirt. Makes a final note:

> **SUBJECT: AIKO (ECLIPSE, Junior)**
> **SESSION: Programming reinforcement. Alter stabilization.**
> **STATUS: Primary alter dominant. Origin personality contained.**
> **NOTE: Origin memories resurfacing faster than projected. Third session this month. Consider pharmacological adjustment.**
> **EXHIBITION CLEARANCE: Approved.**

She turns off the light. Aiko sleeps in the dark.

**THE CAMERA HOLDS** on the room. The only light is the IV drip's pump, blinking green. And in the corner — always in the corner — the red dot of a camera.

## Episode 2: "The War Below"

### ACT ONE — "TERRITORY"

**EXT. TSUKIYOMI ACADEMY — EAST CORRIDOR — MORNING**

The damage. ECLIPSE's tag covers PRISM's mural — an intricate piece that took weeks. Reika's name in sweeping black calligraphy, her signature wings stretching across the wall. It's actually beautiful. That makes it worse.

A crowd of PRISM members stands before it, seething. **MAI** is the loudest.

**MAI**
I'll kill her. I'll actually kill her. Not metaphorically. Literally. I will find Reika and I will END—

**KUMIKO**
*(arriving, coffee in hand, assessing the damage)*
You won't.

**MAI**
I WILL—

**KUMIKO**
You won't, because that's exactly what she wants. If we retaliate before the Exhibition, Helena disqualifies us. Eclipse gets the Arena by default. Reika wins without fighting.

Mai vibrates with fury but says nothing. Kumiko is right and everyone knows it.

**YUI** is crouched by the wall, running her fingers along the paint. She's studying Reika's calligraphy with an artist's eye — grudging respect she'd never voice.

**YUI**
*(quietly)*
She used three layers. Base coat to block our colours, then the black, then a clear seal. This was planned. She brought supplies.

**KUMIKO**
Which means she has access to materials the school store doesn't sell. Which means she has a supply line we don't know about.

**LILITH** arrives. The crowd parts without being asked. She stands in front of the defaced mural. Takes it in. Her jaw tightens.

**LILITH**
How long to restore our piece?

**YUI**
With Mai? Two days. Without Mai's... contributions... one day.

**MAI**
My contributions are ESSENTIAL—

**LILITH**
Restore it. But don't paint over Reika's tag.

Everyone stares.

**LILITH**
Incorporate it. Make her calligraphy part of our mural. Turn her attack into our art. Let the whole school see that the best thing ECLIPSE ever made only works as a detail in something PRISM built.

Silence. Then Kumiko laughs — a single, sharp bark of delight.

**KUMIKO**
That's evil. I love it.

**MAI**
*(grudgingly impressed)*
...Okay, that IS good.

Lilith allows herself a small smile. Then the pressure hits — behind her eyes, that ringing tone. She blinks. For a FLASH — one frame — she sees the corridor differently: colder, institutional, the walls bare concrete instead of decorated. The glimpse of what this place actually looks like underneath the programming's filter.

Then it's gone. She rubs her temples.

**KUMIKO**
*(watching closely)*
Headache?

**LILITH**
Didn't sleep great.

Kumiko nods. Files it away. We see her make a decision — and then we see the guilt that follows the decision, a shadow across her face that she doesn't understand and can't name.

---

**INT. CLASSROOM — DAY**

Split-screen showing two simultaneous classes:

**LEFT:** A literature class. A NUN (Sister Catherine, 40s, Irish accent, genuinely passionate about poetry) teaches Matsuo Bashō. Students take notes.

**SISTER CATHERINE**
"The old pond — a frog jumps in, sound of water." Seventeen syllables. Three images. An entire philosophy of presence. Who can tell me why this matters to a soldier?

A student raises her hand.

**STUDENT**
Because a soldier who isn't present is a dead soldier?

**SISTER CATHERINE**
Precisely. Awareness. Stillness. Then action. Bashō didn't write poetry. He wrote combat doctrine.

**RIGHT:** Hand-to-hand combat training. A different NUN (Sister Mace, 30s, built like a middleweight, covered in faded tattoos that disappear under her habit) runs drills. Students spar in pairs. The fighting style is a brutal composite — judo groundwork, Krav Maga strikes, Filipino knife work.

Lilith and Kumiko spar in the centre. They're evenly matched — Lilith with raw power and instinct, Kumiko with precision and prediction. Kumiko has seen Lilith fight a thousand times. She knows every pattern.

**SISTER MACE**
Lilith. You're telegraphing your right cross. Your shoulder rises before your hand moves.

**LILITH**
*(mid-exchange, breathing hard)*
I know. I can't stop doing it.

**SISTER MACE**
Then change it. Make the telegraph the feint. Let them expect the right. Give them the left.

Lilith adjusts. Throws the right — Kumiko reads it, moves to counter — and Lilith pivots into a left hook that clips Kumiko's jaw. Not hard. A tap. But it landed.

**KUMIKO**
*(rubbing her jaw, impressed)*
...Okay. That's new.

**LILITH**
*(grinning)*
Learned from the best.

Sister Mace nods. Satisfied. She loves these girls. She trains them to survive. She doesn't let herself think about *what* they need to survive, or why.

---

**INT. ECLIPSE DORMITORY — DAY**

A different aesthetic. Where PRISM's territory is warm and chaotic — posters, colour, mess — ECLIPSE is cold and immaculate. Monochrome. Black and silver. Military precision in every detail. Beds made with hospital corners. Boots aligned. It looks like a barracks designed by a fashion house.

**REIKA** sits cross-legged on her bed, polishing a wooden tonfa (a baton weapon) with meditative focus. She's 17, Japanese, stunning in a way that's calculated — every aspect of her appearance is deliberate, maintained, weaponised. Her hair is cut asymmetrically: shaved on the left, flowing on the right. Her eyes are the flattest thing in the room.

She is the captain of ECLIPSE. She is, by any measure, a sociopath. But the show won't use that word, because the show understands that "sociopath" in this context is complicated — she's a product of the same programming as everyone else. Her lack of empathy isn't natural; it was installed. She was made this way because the Consortium needed a counterweight to Lilith, and Dr. Luke designed her to be one.

The difference: Reika's programming is *thinner*. Not failing — deliberately reduced. She's been promoted to a semi-aware state as a reward for performance. She knows things the others don't. Not everything. But enough to be dangerous.

Her lieutenant, **SORA** (17, Japanese, tall, quiet, a sniper's patience in everything she does), enters.

**SORA**
They're not retaliating. Kumiko's pulling them back.

**REIKA**
*(not looking up)*
Expected. Kumiko always pulls them back. She's a leash.

**SORA**
Lilith said to incorporate your tag into their mural.

Reika's polishing stops. A beat.

**REIKA**
*(the faintest smile)*
That's... clever. She's getting cleverer.

**SORA**
Is that a problem?

Reika resumes polishing. The smile doesn't leave, but it changes — becomes something colder.

**REIKA**
It might be an opportunity. The smarter she gets, the closer she is to seeing what I see. And if she sees it...

She doesn't finish the sentence. Sora waits. Reika puts down the tonfa.

**REIKA**
How are the juniors? Ready for the Exhibition?

**SORA**
Aiko's been in sessions all week. She's... blank. But functional.

**REIKA**
*(something passing behind her eyes — almost concern, quickly buried)*
Functional is enough.

She stands. Checks her reflection. Adjusts the asymmetric fall of her hair.

**REIKA**
We don't need to win the Exhibition, Sora. We need to make PRISM show what they really are. And PRISM doesn't know what they really are yet.

*(beat)*

But I think their captain is starting to figure it out.

---

### ACT TWO — "THE ARENA"

**INT. THE ARENA — LATE AFTERNOON**

The Arena is the school's converted gymnasium, but calling it a gymnasium is like calling the Colosseum a sports facility. It's been rebuilt over years — reinforced floor, padded walls (dented, stained), bleachers on three sides that can hold the entire student body. Banners hang from the ceiling: PRISM's fractured-light emblem on one side, ECLIPSE's crescent-in-shadow on the other. Battle scars everywhere — impact marks in the walls, replaced floor panels, a scoreboard that tracks seasonal records.

This is where the gangs settle things. Not in the corridors, not in ambushes — here, with rules, with witnesses. Mother Superior Helena sanctioned it years ago as a "controlled outlet." She thinks she's managing violence. The Consortium thinks she's producing content.

**EXHIBITION DAY.**

The bleachers are packed. Every student in the school. PRISM's supporters on the left — loud, rhythmic chanting, coordinated colour (white and prismatic). ECLIPSE on the right — silent until they're not, dressed in black, silver face paint on the most devoted.

Ninja Nuns line the perimeter. Medical station in the corner — a Nun who doubles as a combat medic, supplies that would look at home in an ER.

**MOTHER SUPERIOR HELENA** presides from a raised platform. Her expression says she hates this. Her presence says she knows it's necessary.

In a DARKENED ROOM elsewhere in the school — Dr. Luke watches through the Arena's 16 camera feeds. She speaks into a mic.

**DR. LUKE**
All feeds nominal. Broadcast team, confirm uplink.

**VOICE (OFFSCREEN)**
Uplink confirmed. We have 347 active viewers.

**DR. LUKE**
Good. Make sure the facial angles are optimised on PRISM's captain. She's the draw.

On one of her monitors: a CHAT LOG scrolling — messages from the broadcast audience. Rich, powerful men commenting in real time:

> *"Double wager on PRISM's captain. She's in form."*
> *"When does the new ECLIPSE junior fight? The one from the last session footage."*
> *"Can we get a close-up when the twins sync? That's worth the subscription alone."*

Dr. Luke reads the messages. Her expression doesn't change. This is her job.

---

**INT. THE ARENA — CONTINUOUS**

The Exhibition format: Five rounds of paired combat. Each side selects a fighter per round. Points system — clean knockdowns, submissions, ring-outs. No blades, no permanent damage (theoretically). The winning side gets privileges: better food, first access to the recording studio, bragging rights that last until the next Exhibition.

But the real stakes are in the crowd's memory. Whoever fights hardest earns respect that no points system can measure.

**ROUND ONE: MAI (PRISM) vs. ECLIPSE FIGHTER**

Mai is electric. She fights the way she talks — loud, explosive, undisciplined genius. She's not the most skilled fighter in PRISM, but she's the most entertaining, and she knows it. She plays to the crowd between exchanges, mugging, trash-talking.

**MAI**
*(dodging a kick, spinning away)*
Is that the best Eclipse teaches? I've been hit harder by RAINDROPS—

Her opponent lands a body shot that doubles her over. Mai gasps — then grins.

**MAI**
Okay. That was pretty good.

She wins the round on points, barely, after a scramble that has both sections of the crowd on their feet.

In the bleachers, **YUI** sits with her sketchbook. She's not watching the fight. She's drawing. Fast, almost automatic — her hand moving like it's being guided. The image taking shape: Mai, mid-fight, but the Arena behind her is *different*. Older. Darker. Underground.

And on the other side of the Arena — **AIKO** watches from ECLIPSE's bench. Her eyes are clear, focused. Whatever Dr. Luke did in that session, it worked. She looks ready. She looks like someone else.

**ROUND THREE: KUMIKO (PRISM) vs. SORA (ECLIPSE)**

The tactical fight. Two strategists who know each other's playbooks. Kumiko moves with economy — no wasted motion, every step calculated. Sora matches her, patient, waiting for the opening.

They circle for thirty seconds without engaging. The crowd grows restless. Helena watches impassively. Dr. Luke leans forward.

Kumiko feints left. Sora reads it — but Kumiko's already adapted, the feint was testing Sora's reaction time, cataloguing her speed for real-time adjustment. Her photographic memory isn't just visual — it's kinesthetic. She absorbs fighting styles like a language.

She catches Sora with a hip throw that's textbook judo. Sora hits the mat, rolls, comes up swinging — but Kumiko's already moved. She wins on points, clean, efficient.

In the bleachers, Lilith watches Kumiko return. Proud. Grateful. She doesn't know that Kumiko will file a report on her condition later tonight, and that the report will be read by Dr. Luke before morning.

---

**ROUND FIVE: LILITH (PRISM) vs. REIKA (ECLIPSE)**

The main event. The Arena goes quiet before it goes loud.

They face each other at centre mat. Lilith — coiled, present, burning with something she channels into combat the way she channels it into song. Reika — still, analysing, the faintest smile.

**REIKA**
*(barely audible, just for Lilith)*
You've been having headaches.

**LILITH**
*(thrown, covering it)*
What?

**REIKA**
I know the signs. I had them too. Before I started seeing clearly.

**HELENA**
Begin.

Reika moves first — fast, aggressive, breaking her own pattern. She usually waits, lets opponents come to her. Not today. She crashes into Lilith with a combination that's more street fight than martial art. Elbows, knees, a headbutt that splits Lilith's lip.

The crowd erupts.

Lilith reels. Tastes blood. Something SHIFTS.

**FLASH** — one frame — the Arena walls dissolve and she sees concrete, cameras, a room that smells like antiseptic. Then it's gone.

She shakes it off. Meets Reika's next attack with a counter that sends the ECLIPSE captain skidding. Now they're both bleeding. Now it's a fight.

They trade. Evenly matched but differently — Lilith fights with her whole body, emotional, instinctive. Reika fights with her mind, probing, testing, looking for something specific.

She finds it.

In the third exchange, Reika grabs Lilith's wrist and TWISTS — a specific hold, specific pressure, specific angle. It's not a combat technique. It's a **trigger.** Something from a session. Something Lilith's body remembers even if her mind doesn't.

Lilith FREEZES. One second. Two. Her eyes go wide. Her breath stops.

In Dr. Luke's control room:

**DR. LUKE**
*(standing, alarmed)*
She used a trigger. How does Reika know Lilith's triggers—

**VOICE**
Doctor, the biometrics—

**DR. LUKE**
I can see them. Heart rate spiking. Cortisol off the charts. She's dissociating.

Lilith's eyes have gone blank. The Arena is still there but she's not in it — she's somewhere else, somewhere deep, and in that place she can hear—

**A CHILD'S VOICE (V.O.)**
*(far away, echoing)*
Sarah? Sarah, where are you?

The pressure behind her eyes EXPLODES. Not metaphorically. The lights in the Arena flicker. A water bottle on the bench cracks down the middle. Yui, in the bleachers, drops her pencil and grabs her head — she FELT that, through whatever frequency Lilith is broadcasting.

Mai grabs her sister.

**MAI**
Yui? YUI. What—

**YUI**
*(eyes unfocused, speaking in a voice that isn't quite hers)*
She's remembering. The door is open. She's—

Yui blinks. Comes back. Looks at Mai with terror.

**YUI**
Something's wrong with Lilith.

**IN THE ARENA:** Lilith snaps back. The freeze lasted three seconds real-time. Reika is watching her with an expression that is not triumph — it's *confirmation*. She got what she wanted.

Lilith doesn't understand what just happened. But she's ANGRY — the deep, hot, radioactive kind of angry that burns through confusion. She rushes Reika.

What follows is the most brutal exchange of the Exhibition. Lilith fights without technique, without strategy, just force and fury. Reika absorbs it — calculated, rolling with strikes, letting Lilith tire herself. But Lilith doesn't tire. The anger feeds something that shouldn't be accessible, and her hits are landing HARDER than physics should allow. Each impact sounds wrong — too heavy, too resonant, like the air itself is flinching.

Reika takes a body shot that LIFTS her off her feet. She crashes into the Arena wall. Slides down. For the first time in the show, Reika looks genuinely stunned.

Helena stands.

**HELENA**
Enough! Medics—

Lilith is standing centre mat, fists clenched, breathing in ragged bursts. The lights are still flickering. The crowd is dead silent. Everyone felt it — not just the violence, the *wrongness* of it. Like the room's physics briefly stopped applying.

Lilith looks at her own hands. They're shaking. Not from exhaustion — from force she didn't know she had.

Reika pulls herself up. Waves off the medics. Wipes blood from her mouth. And across the Arena, she catches Lilith's eyes and NODS. A tiny, deliberate nod. *Yes. Now you feel it.*

Dr. Luke's hands are shaking too, but for different reasons. On her screens, Lilith's biometric data is doing things she's never seen — psychic output readings that dwarf anything in her files.

**DR. LUKE**
Schedule an emergency session. Tonight. Override everything.

**VOICE**
Doctor, the broadcast audience is requesting—

**DR. LUKE**
*(cold, controlled fury)*
I don't care what the audience is requesting. Schedule the session.

---

### ACT THREE — "WHAT LIES BENEATH"

**INT. PRISM DORMITORY — LILITH'S ROOM — EVENING**

Lilith sits on her bed. Ice pack on her knuckles. Split lip crusted. She's staring at the wall.

Kumiko sits across from her. Patient. Waiting.

**LILITH**
I don't know what happened in there, Kumi.

**KUMIKO**
You won. You beat Reika—

**LILITH**
That's not what I mean.

*(beat)*

She grabbed my wrist. And I... went somewhere. Just for a second. Like a — like a channel changed. And there was a voice.

**KUMIKO**
What kind of voice?

**LILITH**
A kid. A little kid. Calling a name I don't know.

Kumiko is very still. Inside her, two things are at war: the friend who wants to help, and the handler-programming that's already composing the report. She doesn't know these things have names. She just feels the pull in two directions and hates herself for reasons she can't articulate.

**KUMIKO**
You should talk to Dr. Vasquez. That's what she's there for.

**LILITH**
*(looking at Kumiko directly)*
Do you ever feel like something's... under everything? Like there's a floor beneath the floor, and if you step wrong, you'll fall through?

**KUMIKO**
*(barely a whisper)*
...No.

She's lying. She doesn't know she's lying. The programming won't let her know.

**LILITH**
Reika said something. Before the fight. She said she "started seeing clearly." What does that mean?

**KUMIKO**
It means Reika's messing with your head. That's what she does. Don't let her.

Lilith nods. Accepts it. Shouldn't.

Kumiko squeezes her shoulder and leaves. In the corridor, she stops. Leans against the wall. Presses her palms into her eyes.

Then she takes out her phone and types a message to a contact listed only as **D.V.**:

> **K: She's escalating. Dissociative episode during the Exhibition. Auditory hallucination — child's voice, unfamiliar name. Requesting guidance.**

The reply comes in seconds:

> **D.V.: Noted. Session scheduled. Keep her calm. You're doing well, Kumiko.**

Kumiko reads the praise. It makes her feel good. That makes her feel sick. She can't explain either reaction.

She deletes the messages and walks away.

---

**INT. THE TWINS' ROOM — SAME TIME**

Mai is pacing. Yui is sitting on her bed, staring at her sketchbook, which is open to the page she drew during the fight.

The drawing: Lilith in the Arena. But behind her — barely visible, sketched in light, frantic strokes — a SECOND FIGURE. Smaller. Younger. A girl with brown hair and terrified eyes, reaching out from behind Lilith like a ghost trying to step into a living body.

**MAI**
What happened to you in there? You grabbed your head and started talking weird—

**YUI**
I felt her, Mai. Not like — not like when we feel each other. Different. Like a radio station bleeding through. She was broadcasting.

**MAI**
Broadcasting what?

**YUI**
Fear. Old fear. And a name. Over and over. "Sarah."

**MAI**
Who's Sarah?

Yui looks at the drawing. At the ghost-girl behind Lilith.

**YUI**
I think... she is.

Long beat. Mai stops pacing.

**MAI**
*(quiet, the loudest girl in school suddenly very small)*
What does that mean, Yui?

**YUI**
I don't know. But I'm scared.

Mai sits next to her sister. Takes her hand. They don't speak. They don't need to — the link carries what words can't. And through the link, they both feel it: something is wrong with this school. Something has always been wrong. And whatever Lilith is waking up to, they're starting to feel it too.

In her sketchbook, on the next blank page, Yui's hand starts moving again. Unconscious. Automatic.

The drawing that takes shape: the Undercroft. Tunnels she's never seen. Rooms she's never entered. A girl in a white chair, electrodes on her temples, eyes blank.

She doesn't know she's drawing the room from the cold open. But the image is exact.

---

**INT. DR. LUKE'S OFFICE — NIGHT**

Not the session room from the cold open — Dr. Luke's personal office. Warmer, but only by design. Books. A tea set. A framed photo on the desk that we can't quite see. The screens are here too, but smaller, less dominant. This room is where Dr. Luke is a person, not just a function.

Lilith sits across from her. Relaxed — this is familiar. She's been coming here for years. Dr. Luke has been the one constant in her life: kind, patient, always available. Lilith trusts her more than anyone except Kumiko.

That trust is the foundation of her cage.

**DR. LUKE**
Tell me about the fight.

**LILITH**
We won. I beat Reika. But—

**DR. LUKE**
But?

**LILITH**
Something happened. When she grabbed my wrist. I... left. For a second. Like I was somewhere else.

**DR. LUKE**
*(carefully neutral)*
Where?

**LILITH**
I don't know. Somewhere cold. Small. And I heard a voice. A kid's voice. Calling someone named Sarah.

Dr. Luke writes nothing down. She doesn't need to — the room is recording everything. But the absence of note-taking is itself a technique: it signals to Lilith that this is *casual*, not clinical. Safe.

**DR. LUKE**
Have you been sleeping well?

**LILITH**
Not great. Weird dreams. Can't remember them when I wake up.

**DR. LUKE**
The Exhibition puts a lot of stress on everyone. Your body processes that stress in different ways — sometimes through dreams, sometimes through momentary dissociation under physical strain. It's very common.

**LILITH**
It didn't feel common. It felt like remembering something I never lived.

Beat. Dr. Luke meets her eyes. And here's the performance — the greatest performance in the school, better than anything PRISM or ECLIPSE will ever put on stage:

**DR. LUKE**
*(warm, certain, absolutely convincing)*
You've been here since you were eleven, Lilith. Six years of training, performing, leading. Your mind holds more than most adults ever will. Sometimes fragments surface — pieces of things you've read, seen in movies, heard from other students. Your brain remixes them into something that feels like memory. It's not. It's just noise.

She reaches across and takes Lilith's hand.

**DR. LUKE**
You are Lilith Thorne. Captain of PRISM. The strongest student I've ever worked with. That's not noise. That's who you are.

Lilith feels the reassurance wash over her. It works. It's designed to work — the hand contact, the eye contact, the specific phrasing. Dr. Luke has given this exact speech, with minor variations, hundreds of times.

**LILITH**
*(relaxing)*
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I've just been stressed.

**DR. LUKE**
I'm going to adjust your sleep medication slightly. Just a small change — you'll dream less. And I want to see you twice this week instead of once. Just to check in.

**LILITH**
Okay. Thanks, Dr. Luke.

**DR. LUKE**
Always.

Lilith leaves. She feels better. That's the worst part.

After the door closes, Dr. Luke's composure doesn't crack — it *calculates*. She pulls up Lilith's file. The biometric data from the Arena fight plays back in graphs and waveforms.

**DR. LUKE**
*(to herself)*
The telekinetic output alone...

She opens a SECOND FILE. Classified, higher encryption. Labelled:

> **PROJECT: KAGUYA**
> **ASSET CLASS: ALPHA**
> **SUBJECT: THORNE, L.**

Inside: Documentation going back six years. A photo of a girl — brown-haired, blue-eyed, maybe ten or eleven. **SARAH COLE.** Next to it, a photo of Lilith now. The same face, rebuilt. Blonde hair, confident posture, a stranger wearing a stolen body.

Dr. Luke scrolls through the file. Stops at a section titled **CAPABILITY CEILING — REVISED ESTIMATES.**

She reads. Her expression shifts — something we haven't seen before. Not love, not calculation.

Fear.

She closes the file. Picks up a secure phone. Dials.

**DR. LUKE**
It's Vasquez. I need to speak with the Director. Yes, it's about PRISM's captain. Her capability ceiling... I think we underestimated it. Significantly.

*(listening)*

No. She's contained. For now. But the programming is degrading faster than projected, and what's underneath is—

*(she stops herself)*

I'll send the data. But the Exhibition proved something I need to flag: when she destabilised, the readings weren't consistent with our models. They were consistent with something from the Kaguya archives. The older archives.

*(long pause)*

Yes. I know what that means. That's why I'm calling.

She hangs up. Stares at the phone.

On her desk, the framed photo: a younger Dr. Luke — pre-transition, softer, smiling — standing with a group of girls in school uniforms. A different school. A different program. Years ago. Some of the girls in the photo are smiling. Some have the same blank, medicated eyes as Aiko.

Dr. Luke turns the photo face-down. Pours herself tea. Her hands are perfectly steady.

They shouldn't be.

---

### ACT FOUR — "FAULT LINES"

**EXT. TSUKIYOMI ACADEMY — NIGHT — THE GROUNDS**

Late. Past curfew. The school sleeps — or at least, the parts of the school that are allowed to sleep.

Lilith can't. Dr. Luke's adjusted medication sits on her nightstand, untaken. For the first time in years, Lilith has chosen not to follow doctor's orders. She can't explain why. It felt important.

She's on the roof of the dormitory building, legs dangling over the edge, looking out at the sea. The moon is high. The torii gate at the dock casts a long shadow.

Footsteps behind her. She tenses — then recognises the gait.

**LILITH**
You shouldn't be up here, Kumi.

Kumiko sits beside her.

**KUMIKO**
Neither should you. What happened to "I'm just stressed"?

**LILITH**
I lied to Dr. Luke. Not about the stress — about being okay with her explanation.

**KUMIKO**
What wasn't okay about it?

**LILITH**
The name. Sarah. She said it was noise — random fragments my brain stitched together. But it didn't feel random. It felt like *mine*. Like I was the one being called. And I didn't answer.

The moonlight catches both their faces. Kumiko looks at her friend — really looks — and for a moment the handler-programming and the friendship exist in the same space without cancelling each other out. She feels the pull. Both directions at once.

**KUMIKO**
What do you want to do?

**LILITH**
I want to find out why Reika knows things about me that I don't know about myself. She KNEW what grabbing my wrist would do. That wasn't a fighting technique. That was... something else.

**KUMIKO**
*(careful)*
Reika manipulates people. That's her thing—

**LILITH**
This was different. She looked at me after, Kumi. Not like she'd won. Like she was *glad*. Like she'd been waiting for me to feel what I felt. Who does that?

Kumiko has no answer. Or rather, she has an answer buried so deep under programming that it might as well not exist: *Someone who's already awake.*

**KUMIKO**
We can't talk to Reika. Not before the leadership review. Helena would—

**LILITH**
I'm not talking about going through channels.

She looks at Kumiko. And Kumiko sees something in Lilith's eyes that she's never seen before — not the captain, not the fighter, not the performer. Something underneath all of those. Something that's been trying to surface for weeks.

**LILITH**
Something is wrong with this school, Kumiko. I can't tell you what. I can't prove it. But I feel it. Under everything. The floor beneath the floor. And I think Reika feels it too.

The sea wind pulls at their hair. Below them, a Ninja Nun makes her rounds, rosary clicking against her hip. A camera on the roof's edge adjusts silently, tracking them.

**KUMIKO**
*(barely audible)*
Okay.

**LILITH**
Okay?

**KUMIKO**
If you say something's wrong, I believe you. I don't understand it, but I believe you.

It costs Kumiko something to say this. The handler-programming screams at her to report this conversation. The friend in her refuses. For the first time, the friend wins.

She won't report tonight.

She'll hate herself for it in the morning.

**SMASH CUT TO:**

**INT. DANIEL'S APARTMENT — SAN FRANCISCO — DAY**

*(Time zone shift. It's morning in California.)*

A studio apartment that looks like it was furnished by desperation. Mattress on the floor. Takeout containers. A desk buried under papers, printouts, photos, maps. Conspiracy strings — actual red thread connecting pushpins — cover one wall.

**DANIEL COLE** (22, American, dark-haired, the exhaustion in his face aged him five years) sits at the desk, headphones on, listening to something. His eyes are red-rimmed. He hasn't slept.

On his monitor: an encrypted video file, low resolution, heavily compressed. The image is grainy but visible — girls in school uniforms fighting in what looks like a gymnasium. The footage was captured from a broadcast feed, screenshotted, reassembled frame by frame. It looks like it was pulled from hell through a keyhole.

A CHAT WINDOW is open beside the video. The username at the top: **JINX_0x0**.

> **JINX_0x0:** you watching the new clip?
> **DANIEL_C:** yeah. how did you get this
> **JINX_0x0:** don't ask questions you don't want answered
> **JINX_0x0:** look at timestamp 2:14. the blonde.

Daniel scrubs to 2:14. The image clarifies slightly — frame interpolation software struggling with the resolution. A blonde girl in a modified school uniform, mid-fight, face caught in a moment of pure intensity.

He freezes the frame. Stares.

**DANIEL**
*(to himself)*
...Sarah?

The face on screen is older, different hair colour, different bearing. But the bone structure. The eyes. Something in the set of the jaw that photography can't change because it's skeletal.

He pulls up a PHOTO from the wall — a family picture. A girl of eleven with brown hair and blue eyes. Sarah Cole. Age progression software has given him estimates of what she'd look like at 17, but they never looked right.

This looks right. This looks *exactly* right, except for everything that's been changed.

He picks up his phone. Dials.

**DANIEL**
Jinx. The blonde girl. I need everything. The school, the island, the broadcast — everything you've found. All of it.

**JINX (PHONE)**
*(voice: manic, caffeinated, an energy that vibrates through the speaker)*
Danny boy. Welcome to the party. I've been waiting SIX MONTHS for you to say that.

**DANIEL**
I think that's my sister.

Silence on the line. When Jinx speaks again, the manic energy is gone. Just clarity.

**JINX (PHONE)**
Then we better work fast. Because whoever has her doesn't plan on giving her back.

---

**EXT. TSUKIYOMI ACADEMY — DAWN**

Back on the island. A new day. The camera is HIGH — drone-level — looking down at the school as it wakes. Girls moving between buildings. Nuns at their posts. The torii gate catching first light.

Beautiful. Peaceful. Wrong.

The camera DESCENDS — through the roof, through the floors, through concrete that shouldn't exist in a school building — down, down, into tunnels the students have never seen. Past laboratories. Past server rooms where broadcast data is stored and encrypted and transmitted. Past rooms with medical chairs and IV drips and blinking monitors.

Down to a door at the end of a corridor.

The door is labelled:

> **LEVEL 4 — KAGUYA ARCHIVES**
> **CLEARANCE: DIRECTOR + ABOVE**

Through the door — we don't go inside. Just the door. Just the label. Just the implication that there are things beneath this school that even Dr. Luke can't access.

The camera REVERSES — pulling back up through the layers, back to the surface, back to morning light and birdsong and girls in uniforms heading to breakfast.

Lilith walks among them. Laughing with Mai. Arguing with Kumiko about song arrangements. Being, to all appearances, fine.

She doesn't look at the ground beneath her feet.

She doesn't know what's under there.

Not yet.

**POST-CREDITS:**

**INT. CONSORTIUM FACILITY — LOCATION UNKNOWN**

A boardroom. Expensive. Screens showing metrics: viewership numbers, engagement rates, betting volumes from the Exhibition. The numbers are enormous. The Exhibition was their most-watched event in three years.

A MAN (60s, silver-haired, American accent — we don't see his face, just his hands and voice) speaks on a secure call.

**THE MAN**
The PRISM captain's readings from the Exhibition... forward them to the Kaguya team. All of them.

**VOICE (PHONE)**
The Kaguya programme has been dormant for—

**THE MAN**
I'm aware. Reactivate it. If Vasquez's data is accurate — and she doesn't make errors — then we've been sitting on something we didn't know we had.

*(pause)*

And get me Director Fell. It's time he met his investment.

The call ends. The man's hand reaches for a glass of whiskey. On his wrist — a cufflink. An emblem: an eye inside a triangle inside a chrysanthemum. Freemasonic geometry wrapped in Yakuza florals. The Consortium's mark.

He drinks.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

### NOTES ON DIRECTION

**The Cold Open (Dr. Luke's Session):**
- This scene establishes the show's moral line. It is not torture-porn. It is not titillating. It should be shot with the intimacy of a therapy session — close-ups on hands, faces, the IV drip. The horror is in the *gentleness*.
- Dr. Luke is not coded as a villain in this scene. She's coded as a caregiver. That's what makes it unwatchable. The audience should feel their own empathy being weaponised — they feel warmth toward Dr. Luke BECAUSE she's warm, and then they realise what the warmth is covering, and they can't unfeel either response.
- Aiko's "blue door" metaphor: this is based on real trauma-based programming methodology — the creation of internal architecture (rooms, doors, spaces) that the subject uses to compartmentalise identities. The show researched this. It doesn't sensationalise it.

**The Arena Fight:**
- Choreography note: the fight should be shot in LONG TAKES where possible. Not the quick-cut nonsense of most action scenes. We need to see these girls actually fight. The violence should be *legible* — every hit, every dodge, every technical choice visible.
- Lilith vs. Reika should feel like a conversation. They're communicating through combat — Reika is probing, testing, looking for the trigger. When she finds it, the fight changes register. The choreography should shift from structured martial arts to something rawer, more primal.
- The telekinetic burst: play it subtle. Don't go full anime energy-blast. Flickering lights, a cracking water bottle, a subsonic THRUM the audience feels in their chest. The psychic elements should feel *physiological*, not magical. Like a migraine that can break things.
- The twins' reaction: cross-cut between Yui's distress and the fight. Their psychic link means they're an early warning system the school doesn't know it has.

**Kumiko's Betrayal:**
- This is the episode's emotional core. Kumiko doesn't know she's a handler. The audience knows (from the text messages). The tragedy is watching genuine friendship coexist with engineered surveillance.
- The scene on the roof should be the visual opposite of the Arena fight — still, quiet, moonlit. Two friends talking. Except one of them is a cage.

**Daniel's Introduction (Extended):**
- San Francisco should feel grey, cramped, desperate — the visual opposite of Tsukiyomi's curated beauty. Daniel's world is ugly because it's real.
- The moment he recognises Sarah/Lilith on screen should HURT. Don't rush it. Let him sit with the image. Let the audience watch him put it together. This is the scene that launches the external investigation plotline.

**The Undercroft Reveal:**
- The descending camera shot through the school's layers is the visual thesis: surfaces lie. The school is beautiful above ground and monstrous below. The camera move should be continuous — no cuts — sliding through architecture that becomes increasingly wrong. School → offices → corridors → labs → tunnels → the locked door.
- We don't go through the Kaguya Archives door. Not yet. That's Episode 9.

**Sound Design:**
- The LOW HUM from Episode 1 is now associated with the Undercroft — whenever the camera goes below ground, the frequency appears.
- Lilith's "flicker" moments get a new element: the child's voice calling "Sarah" is now part of the sonic palette. It appears as a barely-audible whisper in scenes where her programming is under stress.
- The Arena should be LOUD — crowd noise, impact sounds, the girls' breathing — then SILENT during the telekinetic burst. Complete silence. Then sound crashes back.

*Episode 3: "The Ghost in Room 4-C" — The supernatural element takes centre stage. A genuine haunting. The exorcism mission that changes everything.*
