## GG33 Scoring System v2.0 Update 🎯

Analyzed 7TheNumber7's UFC 324/325 betting picks to improve the prediction system.

### 7's Picks Analyzed:
**UFC 325:**
- Volk ✅ (Dragon soulmate year, home crowd, master 11s)
- BSD/Hooker under R3 ✅ (Hooker LP7 vulnerable)
- Ruffy ✅ (Fiziev signed in Pig year = broken trine)

**UFC 324:**
- Song over O'Malley ❌ (Should've won - Ox trine, but O'Malley born on 24th fighting on 24th)
- Cortes-Acosta ✅ (Lewis had Secondary 7 + PY9 + Age 40 = stacked vulnerabilities)
- Natalia Silva ✅ (Prime age advantage)

### New Factors Added:
1. **Birthday Day Match** +4 (was +1) - Born on 24th, fighting on 24th = powerful
2. **Stacked Vulnerabilities** -2/-3 multiplier when 2+ red flags stack
3. **Home Crowd Advantage** +3 for fighting at home
4. **Fighting Zodiac Enemy** +2 when fighting your enemy sign
5. **UFC Signing Year Conflicts** -3 "Broken Trine" when signed in current year's enemy
6. **Prime Age** +2 for 27-32, -1/-2 for declining/past prime
7. **Personal Year 9** boosted to -3 (endings cycle)
8. **Soulmate Year** boosted to +3

### New Output Fields:
- `finishRisk` / `finishRiskLevel` (low/medium/high/extreme)
- `vulnerabilityCount` (stacked red flags)
- `redFlags[]` / `greenFlags[]` for easy scanning
- `homeAdvantage` / `primeWindow` booleans
- `compareMatchup()` function for head-to-head predictions
