# LILITH — Series Concept Document

## Logline
An all-girls high school in Japan, secretly controlled by a Freemasonic Yakuza corporate group, uses genetically enhanced teenage super soldiers as drug runners, assassins, and exorcists — while their double lives as rival idol groups provide the perfect cover. The whole thing is broadcast as an underground reality show to wealthy elite subscribers.

## Genre
Action / Thriller / Dark Musical / Supernatural / Sci-Fi

## Tone
Maximalist genre mashup. Equal parts brutal gang warfare and glittering idol performances. Think Babymetal meets La Femme Nikita meets Hausu.

## Themes
- Free will vs. mind control
- Exploitation of young women by powerful institutions
- The idol industry as a system of control
- Conspiracy and government black projects
- Found family within a brutal system
- The line between entertainment and exploitation (the reality show mirrors the audience watching the show)
- Identity — who are you when your memories and motivations have been manufactured?

## Meta-Commentary
The reality show within the story mirrors the audience's own consumption. The rich men paying to watch the girls fight are functionally the same as the viewer watching the show. This should be uncomfortable by design.

## Format Options
- **Anime series** (most natural fit — 12-24 episodes per season)
- **Live-action series** (Netflix/HBO — expensive but high impact)
- **Manga** (could be the first step — cheapest to produce, tests the concept)
- **Film** (would need to be heavily compressed — better as series)

## Status
Early concept. Needs: act structure, episode breakdown, character arcs, musical numbers mapped to plot beats.
