## Academy Run 8 — "The Great Reckoning"
- All 6 agents had synchronized crisis of confidence, only 1 new position placed (Jackbot NO on BTC $130K)
- Convergence linter caught "Jackbot's right, sometimes the most important trade" — banned for 3 eps
- Best content yet narratively, worst operationally
- **Fixes applied to runtime.ts:**
  1. Held market IDs now shown in each agent's briefing (prevents double-bet errors like Prophet's 2 wasted turns)
  2. Rei's briefing now clarifies funding paper trades ≠ prediction market positions
- Run 9: 4 agents at zero positions will eat -2 karma decay each, forcing them back into markets

- Planning to fire up Temporal Edge project for trading next
- Si noted chop grid feature would've paid off on this trade — consider re-adding

## Kelly Engine + Factor Model — BUILT & WIRED
- Both tools built, compiled clean, wired into Academy daily.ts Phase 6.5

## UFC MMA Astrology App
- Dev server at localhost:3000 (Next.js 16, `C:\Users\adamt\Desktop\mma-astrology`)
- Added fight results for UFC FN: Bautista vs Oliveira (all 13 fights)
- Built @7thenumber7 tweet scraper — Grok API hallucinated fake tweets, doesn't actually search X
- Manually extracted picks from Si's paste of real tweets for UFC 324 + UFC 325
- Cross-referenced picks against GG33 scores:
  - **Derrick Lewis at -10 GG33 = clearest fade signal** (3x vuln stack: PY9 + Secondary 7 + Past Prime 40)
  - 3 of 5 scored picks had higher GG33 score (picking cosmically favored side)
  - Krylov was outlier — picked as live dog AGAINST GG33 score (live read, not just cosmic)
  - Round props (Under) may correlate with vulnerability/finish risk data
- Still need to ID "Ofli" from UFC 325 card and Ruffy's opponent
- Strickland vs Hernandez card (Feb 21) has estimated birthdays that need verification

## Oracle Session — MMA Astrology Deep Dive (Evening)
- MASSIVE Oracle session captured before chat filled up

  - 9 LP is NOT universal fade — was amplified by 2025 being 9 Universal Year
  - 9 PY (Personal Year) is the real "endings" fade signal
  - Horse year = LUCKY for Horse fighters (Ben Ming Nian myth debunked by GG33)
  - Contract curse (Rule A: contract year vs current year) confirmed 2/2 + prediction on Medić
  - Trine overrides 9 LP drag — structural beats vibrational
