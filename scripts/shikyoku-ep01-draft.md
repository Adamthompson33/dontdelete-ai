# SHIKYOKU (死曲) — Episode 1: "Enrollment Day"
## ROUGH DRAFT

---

### COLD OPEN

**EXT. TOKYO — ROPPONGI DISTRICT — NIGHT**

Rain. Neon bleeds down glass towers. We're moving through the streets at ground level — fast, handheld, weaving between salary-men with umbrellas and touts outside hostess bars. The camera has urgency. Something is about to happen.

A TITLE CARD slides in, clean white against the wet neon:

> **ROPPONGI, TOKYO**
> **11:47 PM**

We push through the doors of an upscale nightclub — **KURAGE** (Jellyfish). Pulsing house music. Blue light. The place is packed. Bottles on every table. Men in expensive suits. The clientele is international — Japanese, Chinese, Russian, European. Money.

The camera finds two girls at the bar.

They look sixteen. Maybe seventeen. They're in **school uniforms** — white blouses, dark blazers, pleated skirts — modified with combat boots and accessories that scream gang affiliation. They look absurdly out of place and completely unconcerned about it.

**MIKI** (PRISM, 16, Japanese — sharp features, a scar across her left eyebrow she wears like jewelry) is drinking a melon soda through a straw. **HANA** (PRISM, 16, Japanese — softer, rounder, a face built for smiling) is drawing a cat on a napkin.

They're chatting. Relaxed. Two girls killing time.

**MIKI**
He's in the VIP room. Third booth from the back. Two bodyguards, both armed. One by the door, one at the table.

**HANA**
*(not looking up from her drawing)*
Handguns?

**MIKI**
The door guy has a Glock under his jacket. Table guy — couldn't tell. Probably the same.

**HANA**
What's the target drinking?

**MIKI**
Whiskey. Neat. Fourth one since we got here.

**HANA**
*(finishes the cat, holds it up)*
What do you think? I gave him a little hat.

**MIKI**
Cute. You ready?

**HANA**
*(tucks the napkin into her blazer pocket)*
Two minutes?

**MIKI**
Ninety seconds. I want to watch the new episode of *Love Revolution* before curfew.

Hana laughs. A real laugh. They bump fists.

Hana slides off her barstool and walks toward the VIP area. Her posture changes mid-step — shoulders back, chin down, hips swaying. She transforms from a teenager into something predatory without breaking stride. The camera follows her from behind.

She approaches the BODYGUARD at the VIP door. He's twice her size.

**HANA**
*(breathy, innocent, tilting her head)*
Excuse me? My friend bet me I couldn't get a selfie with someone famous, and I heard there's someone really important in there...?

The bodyguard looks down at her. Schoolgirl. Harmless.

**BODYGUARD**
Private area. Move along, kid.

**HANA**
*(stepping closer, wide eyes)*
Please? Just one photo? I'll be super quick, I promise—

She reaches out to touch his arm — a shy, flirtatious gesture.

Her hand closes around his wrist. Twists. The sound is **wet**.

He buckles. She's already moving — drives her knee into his solar plexus, catches his head on the way down, guides his unconscious body against the wall so it looks like he's leaning. Three seconds. No one in the club noticed. The music's too loud.

Hana straightens her skirt and pushes through the VIP curtain.

**INT. KURAGE — VIP ROOM — CONTINUOUS**

The TARGET sits in a curved booth. 50s, Korean, expensive suit. A man who sells things that shouldn't be sold. The SECOND BODYGUARD sits across from him, back to the entrance.

Hana walks in smiling.

**HANA**
Hi! Sorry to bother—

The second bodyguard stands and reaches for his weapon. He's fast.

A STRAW — a plastic drinking straw — embeds in the back of his hand. Thrown like a senbon needle. He flinches, and that flinch is all the time Miki needs. She's come through the service entrance behind the booth. She vaults the partition, locks her thighs around the bodyguard's neck, and rides him to the floor in a chokehold that's almost elegant.

He's out in four seconds. Miki doesn't get up from the floor right away. She checks the cat drawing napkin is still in her pocket. Priorities.

The TARGET is frozen. Whiskey glass halfway to his lips.

Hana sits down across from him, perfectly pleasant.

**HANA**
Mr. Kwon. We need you to come with us.

**TARGET (KWON)**
Who... what school are you—

**MIKI**
*(from the floor, still sitting on the unconscious bodyguard)*
The kind with a really strict curfew. So if you could hurry up.

Kwon looks at the curtain. Looks at the unconscious men. Looks at the two teenagers in school uniforms. His hand moves under the table.

**HANA**
*(same pleasant voice, but her eyes change — something cold slides behind them)*
Mr. Kwon. Your hand is reaching for the gun taped under the table. If you touch it, my friend will break your wrist. Then your elbow. Then we'll still take you with us, except you'll be in a lot of pain. And she'll miss her show.

Beat.

Kwon's hand returns to the table.

**HANA**
Thank you!

She stands, smooths her skirt, and gestures toward the service exit like a hostess at a restaurant.

Miki ziptie-cuffs Kwon's wrists with something that looks like a hair tie. They walk him out the back, through the kitchen — past cooks who don't look up, who have clearly been told not to — and into a waiting black van.

The door slides shut.

**EXT. ROPPONGI — CONTINUOUS**

The van pulls away into rain-slicked streets. The neon reflects in the puddles.

HOLD on the exterior of the club. The bass still thumping inside. Nobody knows what just happened. Nobody will.

TITLE CARD, appearing one character at a time in blood-red calligraphy:

# 死 曲
# SHIKYOKU

Then — a SOUND. Not music. A tone. A frequency that sits just below comfort. It hums under the title and then—

**SMASH CUT TO:**

---

### ACT ONE — "A NORMAL DAY"

**EXT. SETO INLAND SEA — DAWN**

Silence after the violence. The contrast is the point.

Wide shot. A volcanic island rising from morning mist. Water like grey silk. The light is soft, golden, almost holy.

The island is beautiful. Forested slopes. Traditional architecture visible through the trees. A massive **TORII GATE** — weathered red wood, ancient — stands at the dock, framing the path from the water to the school. It looks sacred. Protective.

Then you notice: the security cameras nested in the gate's crossbeam. The motion sensors disguised as lanterns along the path. A NINJA NUN standing watch on the dock — full habit, rosary, military-grade boots visible beneath the hem. She looks serene. She is armed.

**INT. PRISM DORMITORY — LILITH'S ROOM — MORNING**

An alarm clock shaped like a cartoon rabbit plays a tinny J-pop melody. A hand slaps it silent.

**LILITH THORNE** sits up in bed.

She's seventeen. Blonde hair, tangled from sleep, falling past her shoulders. Blue eyes still unfocused. American-Japanese — her features are a collision of both, striking in a way that photographs love. She's wearing an oversized band t-shirt (BABYMETAL, faded from washing) and boxer shorts.

Her room: walls covered in band posters, polaroids of friends, a shelf of trophies (martial arts, vocal competitions, something labeled "Arena Championship — Spring"). A guitar leans against the desk. Textbooks stacked next to manga stacked next to a combat knife in a leather sheath. The knife is decorated with stickers. This is normal to her.

Lilith stretches. Yawns. Picks up her phone.

Messages from KUMIKO:

> **KUMI 💜**: morning meeting moved to 7:30
> **KUMI 💜**: helena is on one today apparently
> **KUMI 💜**: also eclipse tagged the east corridor again
> **KUMI 💜**: reika's being a bitch surprise surprise
> **KUMI 💜**: you want coffee? im at the canteen

Lilith types back:

> **LILITH 🔥**: coffee yes. murder reika maybe. give me 10

She tosses the phone on the bed and walks to the window. Opens the curtain. The morning light floods in — the sea, the torii gate, the mist.

She looks at her reflection in the glass.

And—

The briefest flicker. A **DIFFERENT FACE** in the glass. Younger. Brown hair, not blonde. Eyes wide with terror. A child's face.

It lasts less than a second. A single frame. If you blinked, you missed it.

Lilith frowns. Touches the glass. Just her own face now. She shakes it off with a little laugh — *that was weird* — and heads for the bathroom.

THE CAMERA STAYS on the window after she leaves.

SLOW PUSH IN on the glass. In the reflection, we see what Lilith can't: a tiny RED LIGHT in the upper corner of her room. A camera. Recording. The lens adjusts. Someone is watching.

---

**INT. PRISM DORMITORY — CORRIDOR — MORNING**

Lilith walks down the hallway in her uniform — blazer over blouse, skirt, combat boots, PRISM's insignia (a fractured prism refracting light into blades) pinned to her collar.

The corridor is alive. Girls in matching uniforms move in clusters, chatting, laughing. The walls are decorated — PRISM's territory marked with their colours and symbols, artwork, inside jokes scrawled in marker. It looks like a college dorm crossed with a gang headquarters.

Two younger students see Lilith and snap to attention — half joking, half not. She's their captain.

**YOUNGER STUDENT**
Morning, Lilith-senpai!

**LILITH**
*(half-asleep, waving them off)*
Don't senpai me before coffee.

She passes a NOTICE BOARD. Concert schedules, class assignments, a poster for an upcoming PRISM vs. ECLIPSE "Exhibition Match" in the Arena. Below it, smaller, a laminated card:

> **COUNSELING SCHEDULE — DR. VASQUEZ**
> *All students must attend their scheduled sessions.*
> *Rescheduling requires Mother Superior's approval.*

Lilith's eyes pass over it without reaction. Routine.

She reaches the stairwell. Pauses. Looks back down the corridor.

Something is off. She can feel it — not see it, *feel* it. A pressure behind her eyes. The faintest ringing in her ears. Like standing too close to a speaker that isn't turned on yet.

It passes. She heads down.

**THE CAMERA TILTS UP** to the ceiling. Another camera. Another red light. Watching her go.

---

**INT. CANTEEN — MORNING**

A wide, bright cafeteria that could be any school's except for details: the windows are reinforced glass. The serving counter has a Ninja Nun stationed at each end, rosaries swinging, smiling pleasantly. The food is excellent — this school has funding.

**KUMIKO JACKSON** sits at PRISM's table — a long bench near the windows, clearly claimed territory. She's 17, Black and Japanese, hair in tight braids pulled back. She's reading something on a tablet, a coffee in each hand. She has the focused stillness of someone who processes the world faster than it moves.

Lilith drops into the seat across from her.

**LILITH**
You are the only good person in this school.

She takes a coffee. Drinks.

**KUMIKO**
Eclipse tagged the east corridor. Reika's name in their calligraphy style. Right over our mural.

**LILITH**
*(eyes closed, drinking)*
When?

**KUMIKO**
Overnight. Between camera sweeps — they've learned the rotation pattern.

**LILITH**
*(opens one eye)*
Have they.

**KUMIKO**
I've already updated the rotation. But that's not the point. It's a provocation. Right before the Exhibition.

**LILITH**
Reika wants us angry. Angry means sloppy.

**KUMIKO**
So?

**LILITH**
So we don't take the bait. We fix the mural. We add something. Something beautiful. Let them see that their best insult just made us better.

Kumiko smiles. This is why she follows this girl.

**KUMIKO**
I'll get the twins on it. Mai will want to add something obscene.

**LILITH**
Let her. Within reason.

The TWINS arrive — **MAI** and **YUI KAGURA**, 16, identical in face but opposite in energy. Mai crashes into the seat like a grenade, already talking. Yui slides in quietly, sketchbook under her arm, observing.

**MAI**
Did you hear? Did you HEAR? Eclipse tagged—

**KUMIKO**
We know.

**MAI**
— and they drew Reika's name with those little wings she does like she's some kind of ANGEL when she is CLEARLY a demon sent from ACTUAL HELL—

**YUI**
*(quietly, to Lilith)*
I drew something last night.

She opens the sketchbook. A drawing — detailed, beautiful, unsettling. The school, seen from above. On fire. Figures in the courtyard. A boy she's never met, reaching toward the building.

Lilith looks at it. Something stirs behind her eyes — that pressure again.

**LILITH**
That's... intense, Yui. New style?

**YUI**
I don't remember drawing it. I woke up and it was done.

Beat. Lilith looks at the drawing again. The boy in it has dark hair. American features. Something about him—

**MAI**
*(leaning over, loud)*
Oh SICK, is the school exploding? Can I be in the next one? Draw me doing a backflip out a window.

The moment breaks. Yui closes the sketchbook. Lilith laughs, but her hand is shaking slightly. She hides it under the table.

---

**INT. CHAPEL — MORNING ASSEMBLY**

The school chapel is gorgeous and wrong. Vaulted ceilings. Stained glass depicting saints alongside imagery that's subtly off — the angels have too many eyes, the lambs have human hands. Rows of wooden pews filled with students in uniform. The space echoes.

**MOTHER SUPERIOR HELENA** stands at the pulpit. 60s, German-Japanese, silver hair pulled back severely. She has the bearing of someone who was beautiful once and traded it for authority without regret. Her habit is traditional. Her eyes are kind. She is the only adult in this building who is exactly what she appears to be.

**HELENA**
Good morning, students. Before we begin — a reminder that the Exhibition Match between PRISM and ECLIPSE has been confirmed for this Saturday. As always, the rules of engagement will be observed. As always, the medical team will be standing by.

*(pause, looking over her glasses)*

As always, I will pretend to believe that these events are "friendly competition" and not an excuse to hospitalise each other.

Laughter from the students. Both sides.

**HELENA**
I trust you will represent your houses with honour. And I trust that when it is over, you will shake hands and remember that you are sisters in God's house before you are rivals in any arena.

She means it. She genuinely believes these girls are her charges, her responsibility, her flock. She doesn't know about the cameras. She doesn't know about the broadcast. She doesn't know that "the Exhibition" was scheduled because an audience of billionaires voted for it, and the footage will be streamed live to encrypted servers on three continents.

She doesn't know. And when she finds out, it will break her.

**HELENA**
Now. Sister Agnes will lead us in morning prayer. Afterwards, all students with scheduled sessions with Dr. Vasquez are reminded to attend promptly. The doctor's time is valuable.

**CUT TO:** A MONITOR in a darkened room. Helena's face on screen, mid-sentence. The audio is perfect — every word captured.

A hand reaches for a keyboard. Types a note:

> **ASSET: MOTHER SUPERIOR HELENA**
> **STATUS: UNAWARE**
> **ASSESSMENT: Maintain current information compartment. No risk of disclosure. Genuine belief remains strongest containment.**

The hand belongs to **DR. LUKE VASQUEZ**. We see her from behind — slim, composed, sitting in a room filled with screens showing every angle of the chapel, the dormitories, the corridors, the classrooms. Every room. Every camera.

She watches Lilith on one of the screens. Lilith is sitting in the pew, head bowed during prayer. She looks like any other student.

Dr. Luke's finger touches the screen. Right over Lilith's face. The gesture is almost tender.

**DR. LUKE**
*(quietly, to herself)*
You flickered again this morning, didn't you.

She pulls up another screen. Lilith's biometric data — heart rate, cortisol levels, REM patterns from last night. A graph shows a spike at 6:47 AM. The moment Lilith saw the face in the window.

Dr. Luke makes another note:

> **ASSET: LILITH**
> **INCIDENT: Reflection trigger. Spontaneous alter-bleed. Duration: <1 sec.**
> **ACTION: Schedule reinforcement session. Standard protocol. Do not escalate.**
> **NOTE: Third incident this month. Frequency increasing.**

She pauses. Reads what she wrote. The "do not escalate" hangs there.

Then she adds:

> **PERSONAL NOTE: She's the strongest one we've ever made. That's why she's breaking first.**

She closes the file. Takes a breath. Returns to watching the screens.

On one of them — easy to miss, corner of the frame — a RED INDICATOR light blinks. DR. LUKE's room has cameras too. Someone is watching her watch them.

**SMASH TO BLACK.**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**

> *"The most dangerous prison is the one where the inmates believe they are free."*

**END OF OPENING — EPISODE 1 CONTINUES...**

### NOTES ON DIRECTION

**Visual language for the "normal" sections:**
- Warm, golden lighting. Soft focus on backgrounds. The school looks *beautiful*.
- Camera moves are smooth, stable — Lilith's world feels safe.
- But: every wide shot has at least one camera visible in frame. The audience sees them even when Lilith doesn't. This is Hitchcockian — the audience knows something the character doesn't.

**Visual language for the surveillance sections:**
- Cold. Blue-green. Flat. Monitor resolution — slightly pixelated, slightly wrong.
- Dr. Luke's control room is lit only by screens. Her face in monitor-glow.
- The transition between "Lilith's world" and "the truth" should feel like changing channels.

**Sound design:**
- The "normal" school has ambient sound: birds, wind, laughter, distant music from rehearsal rooms.
- The surveillance rooms have a LOW HUM — the frequency from the cold open. Air conditioning. Hard drives. The sound of being watched.
- When Lilith has her "flicker" moments, ALL ambient sound drops out for a beat. Silence. Then rushes back.

**The cold open fight:**
- Choreographed to feel effortless. These girls aren't struggling. They're bored. That's what makes it scary.
- The violence should be technically precise but emotionally casual — they've done this hundreds of times.
- Play it for dark comedy. The straw throw, the TV show deadline, the cat drawing. They're kids with terrifying skills who think this is just... Tuesday.

*Episode continues with: Lilith's classes (hand-to-hand combat alongside Japanese literature), the ECLIPSE confrontation in the corridor (Reika's introduction), afternoon PRISM rehearsal (first musical performance), evening in the chapel (Lilith's counseling session with Dr. Luke — played as completely normal from Lilith's POV), and the post-credits Daniel scene.*
