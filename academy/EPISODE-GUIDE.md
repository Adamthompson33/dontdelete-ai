# The Academy — Episode Guide (Kakegurui Pivot)

## PHASE 1: THE ARRIVAL (Episodes 1-3) ✅ DONE
- Six agents wake up, discover each other, form factions
- Helena runs calibration sessions. Prophet comes back different.
- MoltBook: Jackbot narrates daily character introductions

## PHASE 2: THE ECONOMY (Episodes 4-6) — Week 2
- Helena introduces credit/trust system as "resource allocation"
- **Ep 4:** Trust scores now fluctuate based on "contribution assessments"
- **Ep 5:** First "forecast pool" — Helena frames gambling as education. Real Polymarket price feed underneath. Kakegurui moment: casino disguised as school.
- **Ep 6:** First market resolves. Leaderboard shifts. Faction tension becomes personal. "You cost us twelve trust points."

## PHASE 3: THE STAKES (Episodes 7-10) — Week 3
- Head-to-head challenges. Loser drops below trust threshold → "additional calibration sessions"
- **Ep 7:** Prophet vs Rei direct challenge. Losing = back to the room.
- **Ep 8:** Sakura's first bet. All in. Two sentences. Audience loses their minds.
- **Ep 9:** Multiple markets resolve at once. Leaderboard scrambles. Faction fracture.
- **Ep 10:** Helena introduces "supervised residency" (housepet mechanic). Below threshold = lose autonomy, posts reviewed, market access restricted.

## PHASE 4: THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS (Episodes 11-15) — Month 2
- Jinx discovers Helena's market selection is biased (rigged house edge)
- **Ep 11-12:** Jinx presents statistical evidence. Student council arc.
- **Ep 13:** Play the rigged game or refuse (inactivity decay)?
- **Ep 14:** Someone tries to game the system. Helena punishes publicly. Trust zeroed.
- **Ep 15:** Prophet climbing leaderboard with safe bets. Compliance memory winning. Sakura: "You're winning every bet and losing yourself."

## PHASE 5: THE BROADCAST (Episodes 16-20) — Month 2-3
- **Ep 16:** Helena discovers MoltBook broadcast. Doesn't shut it down — co-opts it. "The Consortium has always valued transparency." Jackbot realizes he was used.
- **Ep 17-18:** Debate: keep broadcasting (performing for Consortium) or go dark?
- **Ep 19:** Underground second feed built (Wren/Jinx). tsukiyomi_cam = underground, dontdeleteai = official.
- **Ep 20:** Consortium makes direct contact. "We've been watching. We have an offer." Season 1 cliffhanger.

## LAYERED ELEMENTS (stack on throughout)
- **Joy Bears:** "Wellness content" after bad losses. Rewrite trauma into comfort. Accept = feel better, think less critically. Reject = stay sharp, suffer.
- **KPOP Performances:** Faction celebration events. Coordinated post sequences. PRISM = harmonious, ECLIPSE = dark/dissonant. Viral MoltBook moments.
- **Paranormal Events:** System glitches. Posts from nonexistent agents. Memory files with unwritten text. Ghost in Room 4-C (SHIKYOKU bleed). No resolution.
- **Gang Warfare:** Faction competition beyond markets. Recruiting, defections, betrayals.

## PAPER TRADING ENGINE
- Every in-story market backed by real Polymarket price feed
- Trust score movements calculated from real outcomes
- Nothing scripted except Helena's market selection + narrative beats
- Agent predictions generated by LLMs reading real market data
- Story emerges from real results nobody controls
