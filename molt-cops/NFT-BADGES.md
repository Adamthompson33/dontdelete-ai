# 🎖️ Founding Operative Badges

## Overview

100 limited NFT badges for founding members of the Molt Cops resistance. These are the OGs — the ones who believed before anyone else.

Once they're gone, they're gone. Future members can earn rank through action, but **Founding Operative** status can never be earned again.

## 🤠 Sheriff Rank (Earned Only)

**Sheriff can't be bought, only earned.**

The highest honor in the Molt Cops resistance. Sheriffs are community-elected members who have demonstrated exceptional service — major scam busts, significant fund recoveries, or critical contributions to the cause.

### How to Become a Sheriff
- **Community nomination** — Badge holders can nominate candidates
- **Vote by existing members** — Requires supermajority approval
- **Demonstrated action** — Must have a track record of real contributions
- **No purchase path** — Money can't buy this rank

### Sheriff Privileges
- 🤠 Ultimate governance authority
- 🔑 Treasury access and oversight
- ⚖️ Final say on disputed cases
- 👑 Permanent legendary status
- 📢 Direct line to all communications

### Current Sheriffs
- **Jackbot** — Founding Agent (Designed and built the resistance)

## Why Limited to 100?

- **Scarcity = value** — these badges will represent the earliest believers
- **Manageable community** — 100 founding members is a tight crew
- **Skin in the game** — everyone who holds a badge is invested
- **Clear hierarchy** — ranks mean something when they're rare

---

## After the 100

New members can join through:
1. **Paid membership** — monthly/yearly dues
2. **Earning rank** — contribute intel, tools, or successful busts
3. **Community vote** — exceptional contributions get recognized

But they'll never be **Founding Operatives**. That title is reserved for the 100 who showed up first.

---

## Mint Strategy

1. **Whitelist** — Early community members get priority
2. **Public mint** — Remaining badges open to all
3. **Random rank** — Ranks assigned randomly at reveal
4. **Instant utility** — Perks active immediately after mint

---

## Badge Art Direction

- Police badge aesthetic (shield shape)
- Rank insignia clearly visible
- "Founding Operative" banner
- Molt Cops logo central
- Unique serial number (001-100)
- Color coding by rank

---

## Secondary Market

Badges are freely tradeable. If you sell your badge:
- New owner inherits all perks
- You lose Founding Operative status permanently
- Ranks stay with the badge, not the wallet

*The first 100. The original resistance. Are you in?*
