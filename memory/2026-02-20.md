# 2026-02-20 — The Desk Goes Live

## Major Milestone: Academy Episode 6 on Real Market Data
- **Taylor** set up Mac Mini, got GitHub access, shipped 7 commits in one evening
- First Academy episode running on live market data (CoinGecko + HyperLiquid + Polymarket)
- Cost: **$0.085 per episode** — 6 agents, real data, structured signals
- Repo: `dontdelete-ai` on GitHub (Adamthompson33)

### What Taylor Built
1. `data-feeds.ts` — unified market data layer (CoinGecko spot, HyperLiquid funding, Polymarket predictions)
2. Rewired `daily.ts` — Helena briefing + market snapshot replacing Manifold
3. Signal-based fitness scoring replacing karma leaderboard
4. SIGNAL action schema for structured output
5. Fixed SIGNAL parser (markdown bold stripping)
6. Reset all agent track records to zero — clean slate for new schema

### Episode 6 Results
- BTC $67,465 (+1.5%), ETH $1,945 (-0.3%), SOL $83.53 (+2.8%)
- Rei & Sakura independently flagged SHORT INJ (-402% funding rate), 68% conf, 8% Kelly
- Prophet went FLAT BTC (cautious)
- Jinx caught 65% correlation risk across positions
- Convergence linter flagged 10 phrases — watch trend over episodes
- Jackbot & Prophet tools still placeholder (temporal edge + UFC not built yet)

### Next Steps (from Oracle)
- Set up daily cron at 00:30 UTC (11:30 AM Sydney)
- Build Jackbot's temporal edge scanner next
- Post Episode 6 signals to ClankerZone tomorrow
- Track convergence trend over episodes
- First properly scored episode tomorrow with clean fitness slate

### Taylor
- Got GitHub push access to dontdelete-ai repo
- Running on Mac Mini (new setup)
- Needs Anthropic API key for agent runs
- Birthday today (Feb 20)
- Built temporal edge scanner (404 lines) — Jackbot's tool, 3rd active scanner
- Total: 9 commits in one night session

## Strategic Pivot: Three Parallel Tracks (Oracle + Si, 3:30 AM)

### Track 1: Academy (Long Game — Product)
- Daily episodes on cron at 00:30 UTC (11:30 AM Sydney)
- 5/6 scanners active (Sakura arb, Rei funding, Jackbot temporal, Wren Kelly, Jinx factor)
- Prophet stays as analyst/devil's advocate — no scanner tool, synthesises and dissents
- Signal archive builds track record for ACP, x402, token narrative

### Track 2: Bot Challenge (Show Me The Money)
- Standalone tools in `bot-challenge/` folder — no Academy overhead
- 12 tools mapped to 12 agents, each runs independently
- Standardised output: direction, confidence, entry, exit, invalidation, kelly
- Paper trade leaderboard: win rate, P&L, Sharpe, max drawdown
- Compare against Academy signals after 2-3 weeks
- **Priority:** Port Jackbot/Rei/Sakura tools first (already have data infra)

### Track 3: Clown Trader (Roblox — Diversified Revenue)
- **Concept:** Players collect AI Jesters, send them on missions
- **Two mission types:**
  - Trade Runs — Jesters trade items, outcomes based on stats + RNG. Low-INT Jesters make hilariously bad trades (meme engine)
  - Royal Court — Jesters perform for Kings. King's mood is hidden. Generous = gold, grumpy = dungeon cooldown
- **Collecting loop:** Jesters in tiers (Common→Mythic), unique personalities, player-to-player trading
- **Visual comedy = organic marketing** — Jesters failing generates TikTok/screenshot moments
- **Monetisation:** Premium eggs, court passes, customisation, save tokens, VIP market
- **Build scope:** Weekend MVP in Roblox Studio, iterate after launch
- **Name:** "Clown Trader" — memeable, searchable, tells you what it is

### Oracle's Honest Assessment
- Academy is NOT the fastest path to making money — direct bots are faster
- Academy's value: portfolio of strategies (not single bet), product (not just tool), learning architecture
- **Recommendation:** Run both. Simple funding rate bot with real capital NOW + Academy daily episodes as long game
- "You're not compute-constrained, you're focus-constrained. Three parallel tracks is manageable."
