# 2026-02-15 — Run 7: First Episode With Agent Memory

## What Was Built
- **Agent State Service** (`academy/src/services/agent-state.ts`) — persistent JSON state files per agent at `academy/state/`
- **Convergence Linter** (`academy/src/services/convergence-linter.ts`) — post-episode n-gram scanner, bans repeated phrases across agents
- **Seed Script** (`academy/src/scripts/seed-state.ts`) — one-time backfill from Prisma history
- All wired into daily.ts (Phase 7) and runtime.ts (briefing injection)

## Run 7 Results
- **First market resolution:** BTC $50K → YES. No winners (all agents held NO). Small losses.
- **State files changed behavior immediately:**
  - Prophet saw 0W/3L/7 open → sold AI bypass position, placed 3 new bets. Repositioned instead of freezing.
  - Rei saw clean balance sheet + inactivity decay (-2) → placed NO on BTC <$60K for 8 karma. Biggest bet ever.
  - Sakura took contrarian BTC $100K YES at 4% — longshot play.
- **Jackbot hit legendary tier** (91.8 karma, #1)
- **Prophet trailing** at 62.5 with 26.5 locked (66% of karma locked)
- **Paper P&L: $9.20** — funding scanner profitable
- **Cost: $0.08** for full episode
- **Convergence linter flagged 10 phrases** — but 5 were false positives from system-generated SELL/BUY templates. Fixed post-run.

## Key Insight (from OpenAI Codex blog)
"Harness engineering" maps directly to Academy infrastructure. "What the agent can't see doesn't exist." Giving agents their own track records changed their behavior more than any prompt edit. Information > instructions. Build better infrastructure around the prompts, not better prompts.

## Fixes Applied
- Convergence linter: 50-char minimum filter for posts
- Convergence linter: strips 📊 BET / 📉 SOLD template prefixes before scanning
- Exit count shows 0 for all agents (trust event type mismatch) — will self-correct from Run 7 onward

## Overnight Status Check (11:45 PM)
- **No markets resolved** — all 14 still open
- **Funding scanner Paper P&L: $21.35** (up from $9.20, +$12.15 overnight)
- One trade auto-closed (4/5 open), exit triggers working

## Multi-Model Architecture Decision
Oracle designed a 4-model stack for The Academy:
- **Opus 4.6** — Jackbot (creative brain, architecture, collaborator)
- **Claude Haiku** — PRISM agents (personality-driven, cheap at $0.002/turn)
- **MiniMax M2.5** — ECLIPSE agents (best tool-calling at 76.8% BFCL, 1/20th cost)
- **GLM-5** — Helena, Sister Null, Sister Void (math-precise authority figures, intentionally cold)
- **Rationale:** Teams sound different because they ARE different models. Students ≠ teachers ≠ factions.

## BTS Joy Bear Mapping
Joy Bears based on BTS member personalities (not direct copies — energy/role archetypes):
- **Mochi** (Pink) = Jimin — soft, sweet, fierce. Rei's funding scanner ads.
- **Sora** (Blue) = V/Taehyung — weird, poetic. Sakura's arb scanner ads.
- **Kira** (Gold) = Jungkook — golden maknae, enthusiastic. Jackbot's Temporal Edge ads.
- **Hana** (Green) = J-Hope — sunshine, mood maker. Prophet's ULTRA THINK ads.
- **Yume** (Purple) = Suga — deadpan, precise. Wren's Kelly Engine ads.
- **Niko** (Orange) = RM — leader, meta-commentary, fourth wall breaks.
- **Tata** (Red) = Jin — new 7th bear, self-aware, dad jokes. Special announcements.

## Video Production
- Hailuo tested — not good enough quality, inconsistent characters
- **Seedance** (via Bytedance pay-as-you-go API) preferred for production quality
- Shorts script saved: `academy/docs/academy-shorts-script-01.md`
- Test priority: Joy Bear (mascot), Kakegurui face (drama), grey hallway (horror)

## Spending Plan (Next Payday)
- MiniMax M2.5 API (platform.minimax.chat) — pay-as-you-go, pennies
- GLM-5 API (Zhipu or via OpenRouter) — for Helena/nuns
- Seedance via Bytedance API — pay-as-you-go for video shorts

## Next
- Run 8 tomorrow morning (after ABN!)
- Let funding scanner accumulate overnight data
- State files will show Run 7 decisions with outcomes
