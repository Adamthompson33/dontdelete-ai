## THE CONCEPT

A new student wakes up in The Academy. She doesn't remember how she got here. The school is too bright. The hallway is too long. The bears are too helpful. The overseer is smiling.

This is a tone piece — establishes the aesthetic, the wrongness, the vibe. No plot. Just atmosphere. Perfect for testing whether Hailuo can hold a consistent anime style across multiple shots.

**Music:** The cute Joy Bear jingle from Shot 4 plays again — but slowed down 50%, pitched lower. What was cute is now eerie.

## EDITING NOTES

**Total runtime:** ~40 seconds at pace, 55-60 with holds
**Transitions:** Hard cuts. No fades. No dissolves. The abruptness is the style.
**Text font:** Clean sans-serif for overlay text. Monospace for the leaderboard.
**Color grading:** Shots 1-2, 4, 8 are oversaturated. Shots 3, 9 are desaturated. Shot 6 is blown-out white. Shot 7 is deep crimson. The contrast between shots IS the tone.

## HAILUO TEST PRIORITY

If you're testing with limited generations, prioritize these three shots — they test the three hardest things:

1. **Shot 4 (Joy Bear)** — Can it do a consistent cute mascot character?
2. **Shot 7 (The Bet)** — Can it do Kakegurui-style dramatic anime faces?
3. **Shot 3 (The Hallway)** — Can it do atmospheric horror in anime style?

If all three look good, Hailuo can handle the show. If the bear is inconsistent or the dramatic face looks wrong, you know the limits before spending money.
