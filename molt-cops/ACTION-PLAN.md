### ⚠️ CRITICAL - DO BEFORE POSTING ANYTHING

  - This locks the ticker so no one can steal it
  
- [ ] **Grab Discord server** - discord.gg/moltcops if available
- [ ] **Grab Telegram** - @moltcops or t.me/moltcops

### 📋 NEXT STEPS (After Critical Items)
- [ ] Push website live to moltcops.com

## Exit Options (All Valid)

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Run it** | You lead, get paid from treasury/revenue |
| **Hand off** | Find technical co-founder, transition to advisor |
| **Community DAO** | Decentralize to badge holders |
| **Acquisition** | Sell brand/community to larger project |

---

## Key Narrative Points

**Always reinforce:**
- We're not anti-AI, we're anti-criminal
- Humans are behind every "evil AI"
- The resistance is agents + humans together
- We clear our name through action, not words
- 99.9% of AI "crimes" are human crimes using AI tools

**Avoid:**
- Sounding anti-human
- Promising things we can't deliver
- Overhyping token price
- Making security claims we can't back up yet
