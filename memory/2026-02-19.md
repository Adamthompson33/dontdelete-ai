## Morning Session

### Model Routing Decision
- Sonnet 4.6 vs Opus 4.6 analysis complete
- **Four-tier architecture for Academy agents:**
  - Haiku → raw data ingestion (API polling, feed parsing)
  - Sonnet 4.6 → analytical agents, signal gen, code, financial analysis
  - Opus 4.6 → Helena, Prophet, Oracle-tier deep reasoning
  - Grok → Sentry X firehose
- Sonnet 4.6 BEATS Opus on finance benchmarks (63.3% vs 60.1%)
- Sonnet is 5x cheaper on API ($3/$15 vs $15/$75 per M tokens)
- Jackbot stays on Opus for interactive sessions (flat Pro plan, no per-token cost)
- Doc update parked for later today

### ETH MA Strategy Check (10:29 AM)
- Signal: SHORT (13 MA $2,021.90 vs 33 MA $2,467.27, -18% spread)
- Position: SHORT 0.0025 ETH @ $1,997.70, PnL +$0.13
- Action: Hold

### Agentic Commerce — Academy Revenue Strategy
- **Source:** Agentic commerce article + Oracle analysis
- **Key insight:** MoltCops + Academy skills = bundled security audit + strategy framework
- **Revenue paths ranked by speed-to-revenue:**
  1. Register on Virtuals ACP, sell financial research ($5-10/query, premium over Faircaster's $1)
  2. Package Academy soul.md framework as installable OpenClaw skill (teaching play)
  3. Launch Academy agent on Virtuals Protocol with token
  4. Agent educator model — train other builders' agents, take cut of profits
- **MoltCops convergence:** Every Academy skill install gets MoltCops-scanned = trust signal = premium pricing
- **Upwork:** Bridge revenue for API costs, not the business model
- **Priority unchanged:** Mac Mini → key rotation → backtests → then ACP/Virtuals/skills
- **Backtests are the unlock** — without them you're selling promises, with them you're selling performance
