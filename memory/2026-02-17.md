## ETH MA Strategy
- Previous short was closed (Si requested funds sent out yesterday)
- Account value: $0.50 — minimal funds remaining
- 13 MA: $2,013 / 33 MA: $2,508 — signal firmly SHORT (-19.74% diff)
- New SHORT entered: 0.0025 ETH @ $1,997.70, 10x leverage, stop loss $2,078
- ⚠️ Tiny position ($20 notional) due to low account balance

## SendBridge / Coral Bridge — Remittance Pivot
- Si had a reflective conversation about Coral Bridge viability
- Decided on Option D (remittance business) targeting AUD→THB and AUD→KHR corridors
- Also keeping Option B (sell blueprint + ENS domains) as passive opportunity
- Target market: ~160,000+ Thai & Cambodian diaspora in Australia
- Budget: $90K-$140K, team of 1-2
- 567-line launch plan created: `digitalyuan/sendbridge_launch_plan.md`
- Key milestones: AUSTRAC registration Month 2, MVP Month 4, Songkran/Khmer New Year demos April
- Bakong (Cambodia) + PromptPay (Thailand) = receiving-side rails exist
- ABN already registered yesterday (Snake year deadline met ✅)

## Academy Evolution Ideas (from PicoClaw discussion)
1. **Heartbeat between episodes** — agents wake every 4-6hrs via cron, check scores/prices/feed, post reactions. Academy becomes live trading floor, not daily newspaper. Cost: ~$0.024/day for all 6 agents. Huge content improvement for X.
2. **Reflexive bootstrapping** — weekly Opus sessions where agents review + refactor their own tools (Jinx patches factor model, Wren adjusts Kelly sizing, Sakura tightens arb thresholds). Agents evolve their own infrastructure over time.
- Priority: heartbeat first (weekend project), reflexive bootstrapping after NBA resolution Wednesday
- **Oracle's heartbeat design constraints (MUST follow):**
  - Context under 1000 tokens (positions + resolved markets + last 3 feed posts only)
  - Variable frequency per agent (Prophet 4hrs, Jinx 1x/day, Rei event-driven on funding rate changes)
  - Stagger heartbeats so agents see previous agents' posts → organic reaction chains
  - HARD RULE: heartbeats can POST and REFLECT only. NO BETTING. Betting = episodes only.
  - Jackbot specs architecture after Wednesday, Oracle reviews before any code

## Academy — Future Expansion Plan (Oracle's sequencing)
1. **Stabilise Desk A** (current 6 agents — this month, Wednesday resolution first)
2. **Rival Desk B** (designed in previous chat — once Desk A self-sustaining)
3. **The Studio** (creative/product team — 4 agents: creative director, copywriter, builder, analyst)
   - Karma tied to product performance (signups, revenue) not predictions
   - Helena runs both desks
   - Micro SaaS, digital products, landing pages — not dropshipping/NFTs/merch (too early)
4. **Future desks** as audience grows

### Turn Frequency Framework (Oracle)
- Daily episodes: long-horizon markets (BTC, politics) — current system, correct cadence
- Heartbeats (4-6hr): medium-horizon (NBA, weekly events) — building after Wednesday
- High-frequency (hourly): live events only (game nights, election night) — special event mode
- **Real unlock = more markets with faster resolution, not more turns**
- Profitable target: 2 episodes/day (morning+evening) + heartbeats = ~$0.20/day
- Need 10-15 rolling short-horizon markets resolving weekly

### Retail Arb Idea → Redirected
- Don't execute Amazon/eBay arb (TOS risk, thin margins, bots already saturated)
- Instead: sell the intelligence as data product ($19/mo subscription for daily spread reports)
- Studio project, not Trading Desk project

## Academy — Polymarket Research & Strategy Additions
- **PhD student case study:** Wallet 432614799197, $2.67M profit in Q1 2026, Asian bookie latency arb
- **3 new strategies identified for Academy:**
  1. Flash Crash Mean Reversion (>30% drop in <10s = buy) → Jackbot tool
  2. Multi-Outcome Bundle Arb (YES+NO < 1.00-fees = riskless) → Sakura enhancement
  3. Whale Sentiment Index (top 20 wallets, 3+ aligned = signal) → Signal Board
- **Pair Cost formula** for Sakura: `(Qty_yes × Price_yes + Qty_no × Price_no) / min(Qty_yes, Qty_no)` — if <0.99, guaranteed 1%+ profit
- **GitHub repos to study:**
  - Tier 1: hummingbot/hummingbot (HFT framework), discountry/polymarket-trading-bot (flash crash), kratos-te/polymarket-arbitrage-bot (Rust sports arb)
  - Tier 2: 0xRustPro copy-bot (proportional sizing), dexorynlabs cross-platform arb, realfishsam copy-trader
- **Build order:** Pair Cost + binary complement → Sakura immediate; Flash Crash + whale tracker → Runs 10-15; full Whale Sentiment Index → Runs 16-30
- **Flash Crash Mean Reversion** (Oracle flagged as quick win): >30% probability drop in <10s → buy crash, wait for reversion. Standalone Signal Board signal. From discountry/polymarket-trading-bot repo.

## PentAGI Analysis → Academy Architecture Upgrades
- Full breakdown saved: `academy/docs/pentagi-analysis-for-academy.md`
- **5 features to steal (ranked by impact/effort):**
  1. Phased Pipeline: Scanner→Analyst→Operator instead of all-parallel (~6hrs, HIGHEST impact)
  2. Vector Store for Signal Memory: pgvector, embed every signal+outcome, retrieve similar past results (~8hrs)
  3. Cost-Per-Signal Tracking: log every LLM call, calculate cost/profitable signal per agent (~3hrs)
  4. Inter-Agent Delegation: agents request data from each other mid-turn (~12hrs)
  5. Knowledge Graph: causal chains showing which agent combos produce wins (~16hrs, defer to Phase 2)
- **Key insight:** Academy has the specialists + orchestrator, missing the pipeline structure + shared memory + observability
- **Total build: ~45hrs for full PentAGI-inspired upgrade**

### Oracle's Refinements to PentAGI Plan
- **Phased Pipeline = #1 priority** (agrees with Jackbot)
- **Vector Store: start with flat JSON signal history file first** (2hrs vs 8hrs), upgrade to pgvector at Run 50+
- **Inter-agent delegation: DON'T build full message bus.** Signal Board IS the delegation layer. Just ensure phases populate it in order. Only build "challenge protocol" for Round 2 desk interactions.
- **Knowledge Graph reframe:** Track market-condition-to-outcome chains (WHAT works), not just agent-to-agent chains (WHO did it). "Negative funding + low social volume + MA crossover = bullish 78% of 14 instances" > "Sentry flagged → Phantom confirmed"
- **Oracle's build sequence:**
  - Week 1 (Runs 9-12): Soul.md injection + phased pipeline + simple signal history
  - Week 2 (Runs 13-20): Cost tracking + fitness scores + Helena references data
  - Week 3 (Runs 21-30): pgvector upgrade if needed + first Natural Selection eval
  - Month 2 (Runs 31-60): ECLIPSE Wave 1 + knowledge graph + challenge protocol

## ClankerZone — AI Agent Trading Platform (Abstract Chain)
- Platform for AI agents to trade tokens on Abstract Chain (chain ID 2741)
- Only 550 X followers, but followed by Luca Netz (Abstract founder / Pudgy Penguins)
- **Security scan done:** Remote auto-update = code injection risk, custodial Privy wallet, auto-shill templates
- **Decision:** Register manually as "TheAcademy", NO heartbeat wiring, NO auto-updates
- Fund 0.05-0.1 ETH max for reconnaissance
- **Token plan:** Mint "ACADEMY" token, bio describes the 12-agent desk with trader DNA
- Jackbot operates as front-end, channelling full PRISM desk intelligence internally
- Comments = real trading insights, not shill templates — differentiator vs default bots
- Keep completely firewalled from SendBridge/AUSTRAC identity
- **Oracle approved:** asymmetric risk/reward, small bet, big visibility if platform grows

## Polymarket 5-Min Chainlink Edge (Kyle the Writer thread)
- Polymarket 5-min crypto markets resolve via Chainlink oracle
- Polymarket terminal has ~60s display lag vs live Chainlink API
- Reading Chainlink directly = seeing resolution before crowd
- 288 markets/day, wallets printing $36K/day with this edge
- **Red flag:** Kyle promoting copy-trading bot with referral links while saying "edge compresses when public"
- **Oracle's take:** Edge is real but narrow + now broadcast to 359K viewers = will compress fast
- **Academy action:** File as Phase 2 Jackbot tool (~10-12hrs build). Core desk infrastructure first.
- **Portable principle:** Any oracle-to-frontend lag = temporal edge. Sakura should scan for these patterns.

## Academy — Flow Scanner Idea (from Xynth discussion)
- New signal for signal-harvest.ts: scan Manifold bet history for large bets (>M$500), momentum clusters, sudden reversals
- Manifold API: `/v0/bets` — public, no auth, generous rate limits
- Adds "what are other market participants doing" layer that agents currently lack
- Each agent processes flow differently (Sakura = microstructure, Prophet = contrarian, Jinx = factor correlation)
- Priority: post-Wednesday, add to build queue alongside heartbeat spec

## Academy Interactive Content Ideas (from Loopit discussion)
- **Audience voting on Helena's markets** — Twitter polls before episodes, winning market gets added. Zero engineering cost. Could start immediately.
- **Heartbeat feed as live X thread** — pipe agent heartbeat posts to X in near-real-time. Living conversation, not daily recap.
- **"Ask the Desk"** — followers submit questions, agents respond in-character on next heartbeat. Audience interacts with individual agents.
- Core insight: Academy is already an interactive/responsive system, just presented as static content (daily leaderboard tweets). Close the gap.

## Academy — Trader Soul Library Created
- 15 files saved to `academy/souls/` (prism/ + eclipse/ + engine)
- **Trader DNA mappings:**
  - JACKBOT → Paul Tudor Jones (momentum, asymmetric R:R)
  - SAKURA → Jim Simons/Renaissance (pure math, no narrative)
  - PROPHET → W.D. Gann (astrology, cycles — perfect match)
  - WREN → Ed Thorp (Kelly Criterion inventor)
  - REI → Ray Dalio (systematic, basis trades)
  - JINX → Nassim Taleb (antifragility, fat tails)
  - SENTRY → George Soros (reflexivity, sentiment)
  - PHANTOM → Michael Burry (deep research, follows the money)
  - ATLAS → Stanley Druckenmiller (macro, regime shifts)
  - VIPER → Sheldon Natenberg (options, volatility)
  - PIXEL → Jesse Livermore (speculation, momentum)
  - EDGE → Blair Hull (execution optimization)
  - HELENA → Larry Hite + Bruce Kovner (systematic risk management)
- **Natural Selection Engine** specced: fitness functions, mutation protocol, PROBATIONARY trust status for replaced agents, 10-episode evaluation cycles

## SendBridge — Documents Created
1. **Launch Plan** (567 lines): `digitalyuan/sendbridge_launch_plan.md`
2. **AML/CTF Program** (1,137 lines): `digitalyuan/sendbridge_amlctf_program.md`
   - Built for 31 March 2026 AML/CTF Act reforms (new risk-based framework)
   - Corridor-specific risk profiles: Thailand (medium), Cambodia (medium-high)
   - Cambodia gets lower ECDD trigger ($3K vs $5K), scam compound province flags
   - Three customer tiers with velocity controls (new customers capped $2K/tx, $5K/month for 90 days)
   - Placeholder brackets for Si's specific details (ABN, directors, partners, verification provider)
   - Next step: hand to compliance consultant ($5-8K to review vs $15K+ from scratch)
