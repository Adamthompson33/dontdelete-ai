## BitsecAI — New Competitor/Ally Intel
- @bitsecai published detailed OpenClaw core codebase security audit
- Found "over 100 exploits" across 400k+ LOC
- Two disclosed publicly: VULN-188 (default admin on empty WebSocket scopes) and VULN-210 (npm install without --ignore-scripts in plugin installer)
- PRs submitted: #12802 (scopes fix), #8073 (--ignore-scripts for plugins), #8075 (--ignore-scripts for skills)
- Positioning: BitsecAI = platform layer audits, MoltCops = skill layer scanning
- **Action: Add MC-026 rule** — Unsafe package install (npm/yarn/pnpm install without --ignore-scripts)
- **Action: Watch** — if they productize into automated scanner, they become direct competitor
- **Narrative opportunity:** "Even OpenClaw's own code had 100+ vulns — imagine unvetted skills"

## Ralv (rAlv) — Competitive Intel
- 3D spatial interface for AI agent orchestration — "StarCraft for agents"
- Site: ralv.ai | GitHub: github.com/ralv-ai (semi-private, community preview)
- Dev: Dominik Scholz | Funded by $STARCRAFT memecoin (65/100 HashEx audit score)
- Uses MCP bridge, Skills.sh integration, Wake Arena for security scanning
- **Overlap with The Academy:** Both are Layer 3 observation/visualization for agents
- **Key difference:** Ralv = operator cockpit (devs/ops), Academy = stadium (everyone + spectators)
- **MoltCops opportunity:** Ralv uses Wake Arena (external). MoltCops could be the trust standard Ralv agents verify against → distribution channel, not competitor
- **Weakness:** Memecoin funding is fragile. No spectator layer. Trust is bolted-on, not native.
- **Action:** Add as market context in roadmap. Don't position against formally yet — too early, too volatile.

## ClawHub Security Scanner Landscape
- **Clawdex v1.0.2 (Koi Security / @wearekoi)** — API-based skill verification, recommended in ecosystem guides, updated 2026-02-10. DIRECT COMPETITOR.
- **Security Sentinel v1.1.2 (autogame-17)** — workspace vuln scanner, broader scope than skill-specific
- **8-10 other security-adjacent skills** on ClawHub (security-scanner, skillscanner, etc.)
- **MoltCops differentiator:** Local-first, no API, works on compromised hosts. Clawdex requires network calls to Koi's API.
- **Threat:** Clawdex getting recommended in "how to set up OpenClaw" guides = mindshare advantage
- **Action:** Monitor Koi Security. They're the real competitor, not BitsecAI.

## SecurityScorecard STRIKE Report — OpenClaw Exposure Crisis
- 42,900 exposed OpenClaw instances across 82 countries (port 18789)
- 15,200 vulnerable to RCE via three CVEs (CVSS 7.8-8.8)
- 78% running older versions (Clawdbot/Moltbot branding), unpatched
- 53,300 instances correlate with prior breach activity
- APT groups (Kimsuky/North Korea, APT28/Russian GRU) operating near exposed infra
- Root cause: default bind to 0.0.0.0 instead of 127.0.0.1
- CVE-2026-25253: 1-click RCE via token theft
- CVE-2026-25157: SSH command injection (macOS)
- CVE-2026-24763: Docker sandbox escape via PATH manipulation
- "Declawed" live dashboard tracking remediation every 15 min
- **MoltCops positioning:** Last line of defense — scans what gets installed even on compromised hosts
- **New rules:** MC-027 (insecure bind address), MC-026 (unsafe package install)
- **Case study #9:** Nation-state actors near exposed agent infra, skills = payload delivery
- **Litepaper v2:** Threat section is no longer hypothetical — APTs are real and documented
- **Total case studies:** 9 (ClawHavoc, Moltbook breach, Grok catfishing, cron disaster, react-codeshift, security-review RCE, O'Reilly backdoor, find-skills auto-install, STRIKE exposure report)
- Their advantage: deep security expertise, responsible disclosure cred
- MoltCops advantage: automated, installable, local-first, already on ClawHub, lives in agent workflow
