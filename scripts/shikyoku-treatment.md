# SHIKYOKU (死曲)
## "Death Song"
### Series Treatment — Season 1

---

## Format & Tone

**Format:** 10-episode anime series (24 min each), designed for live-action adaptation potential
**Tone:** Maximalist genre collision — equal parts conspiracy thriller, action musical, supernatural horror, and black comedy
**Rating:** TV-MA. This is not a sanitized product. The darkness is the point.
**Tonal DNA:** If Quentin Tarantino directed a Studio Trigger anime scored by Babymetal, with scripts by Joss Whedon at his most cynical and Charlie Kaufman at his most paranoid.

**Core Influences & What We Take From Each:**

| Influence | What We Steal |
|-----------|--------------|
| Crows Zero / Crows Explode | The high school gang warfare aesthetic — brutal, hierarchical, territorial |
| The Wanderers | Gang identity as found family, the violence as bonding ritual |
| Sucker Punch | Layered reality — the characters' subjective experience vs. what's actually happening to them |
| Dollhouse | Programmed identities, the horror of discovering you're not who you think you are |
| Hausu | Unhinged supernatural horror that's simultaneously funny and genuinely disturbing |
| La Femme Nikita | The "recruited into becoming a weapon" pipeline, institutional control disguised as care |
| Cabin in the Woods | The meta-layer — someone is watching, someone is controlling, and they think it's entertainment |
| Josie and the Pussycats | Corporate mind control through pop music, played as satire |
| Babymetal | The musical style — J-metal idol fusion, cute and brutal simultaneously |
| Buffy the Vampire Slayer | Monster-of-the-week structure with serialized mythology, quippy dialogue during violence |
| Constantine / Preacher | Religious iconography used for horror, blue-collar attitude toward the supernatural |
| Men Who Stare at Goats | Government psychic programs treated as simultaneously absurd and terrifyingly real |
| Stranger Things | The government conspiracy B-plot, the "normie stumbles into the secret" structure |
| The Long Kiss Goodnight | Amnesiac discovering she's a trained killer, identity fracture |
| Altered States | The visual language of mind control — sensory deprivation, hallucination, ego death |
| Gotham / Suicide Squad | Stylized villains with theatrical personalities, institutional corruption as backdrop |

## The Premise

**TSUKIYOMI ACADEMY** is an elite all-girls school on a remote Japanese island. To the outside world, it produces two of the country's most beloved idol groups — **PRISM** and **ECLIPSE** — whose rivalry is a national obsession covered by every entertainment magazine in Asia.

What the world doesn't know:

The school is a black-site operated by **THE CONSORTIUM** — a Freemasonic-Yakuza hybrid organization that has spent decades perfecting trauma-based mind control. The students are genetically enhanced super-soldiers. Their "idol training" is cover for assassination conditioning. Their "rivalry" is engineered psychological warfare designed to keep them dissociated, competitive, and controllable. The school is wired with cameras and broadcast as an underground reality show to an exclusive audience of ultra-wealthy men who pay millions for access.

The girls don't know any of this. They think they're fighting for glory. They think the ghosts are real. They think this is their life.

Until one of them starts to remember.

## The World

### Tsukiyomi Academy — The Campus

The school sits on a volcanic island in the Seto Inland Sea. The architecture is a deliberate collision: a traditional Japanese Catholic girls' school (funded by a mysterious "benefactor" after WWII) with layers of surveillance technology embedded in every surface. Crucifixes hang next to security cameras. Stained glass windows contain fiber-optic relays. The chapel doubles as a control room.

The school is genuinely haunted. This is not metaphor. The Consortium chose this site because the island sits on a spiritual fault line — a place where the boundary between worlds is thin. The ghosts are real, and they're part of the operation: the students are deployed to contain supernatural threats that the Consortium profits from. Exorcism is on the curriculum, right next to knife combat and vocal training.

**Key Locations:**

- **The Chapel:** Where "counseling sessions" (programming reinforcement) take place. Dr. Luke's domain.
- **The Arena:** A converted gymnasium where PRISM and ECLIPSE settle territorial disputes with baseball bats, chains, and choreographed violence. Cameras capture everything.
- **The Stage:** A professional concert venue built into the school. Where the idol groups rehearse and record. Sound-dampened. Also used for "auditions" — which are really capability assessments.
- **The Dormitories:** Each gang controls a floor. Decorated with their colors and trophies from past battles. Bugged, naturally.
- **The Undercroft:** Below the school, a network of tunnels connecting to Consortium laboratories, armories, and the broadcast facility. The students don't know it exists. Some of them dream about it.
- **The Gate:** A massive torii gate at the island's dock. The only way on or off. Guarded by the Ninja Nuns.

### The Ninja Nuns (修道忍)

The school's "faculty" — a paramilitary religious order that serves as both caretakers and enforcers. They wear traditional habits modified for combat: armored veils, blade-concealing rosaries, tactical boots under floor-length skirts. They are genuine believers who think they're serving God by containing supernatural threats. Most don't know the full scope of the Consortium's operations. They are not villains — they are believers who have been instrumentalized, which makes them tragic rather than cartoonish.

**Mother Superior HELENA** is the school's visible authority figure — the "principal." She believes the school is a sanctuary for gifted girls who would otherwise be lost to the world. She doesn't know about the broadcast. When she finds out, it will destroy her.

### The Consortium

Not a single organization but a network — old Yakuza families with Freemasonic connections dating back to post-WWII intelligence operations (historically accurate: the CIA did work with Yakuza elements during the occupation). They operate through shell companies, cultural foundations, and entertainment conglomerates.

**Their business model is three-fold:**

1. **The Broadcast:** Ultra-premium reality entertainment for the global elite. Think a private streaming service that costs $2M/year for access. The content is the girls' daily lives — the fights, the performances, the supernatural encounters, the emotional breakdowns. Everything is real. Nothing is scripted. The audience votes on escalation events.
2. **Contract Operations:** The girls are deployed as assassins, drug couriers, and supernatural containment specialists. Clients include governments, corporations, and criminal organizations. The idol tour schedule provides cover for international travel.
3. **The Program Itself:** The mind control methodology is the product. If perfected, it can be sold to intelligence agencies worldwide. The school is a proof-of-concept.

## The Characters

### LILITH THORNE — The Protagonist

**Age:** 17. **Nationality:** American-Japanese (blonde, blue-eyed — her mother was Japanese, her father American).

Lilith is the leader of **PRISM**, the school's dominant idol group and gang. She is charismatic, ferocious, tactically brilliant, and absolutely certain that her life at Tsukiyomi is normal. She has no memory of anything before the school. She doesn't question this because she's been programmed not to.

Lilith's "personality" — the confident warrior-queen — is an alter created through trauma-based programming. Underneath it, buried deep, is a frightened girl named **SARAH COLE** who was taken from her family at age 11. The series is the story of Sarah clawing her way back to the surface through the cracks in Lilith's programming.

**Her ability:** Lilith has the most potent psychic capability in the school — precognitive flashes, telekinetic bursts under extreme stress, and an uncontrollable empathic link that occasionally lets her feel what the audience on the other side of the cameras is feeling. This last ability is what begins to break her programming: she starts feeling *pleasure* from her pain that isn't hers. She starts to realize someone is watching.

**Musical role in PRISM:** Lead vocalist. Her performance style is raw, aggressive, emotional — she channels everything she can't consciously access into her singing. The audience (both the public and the secret broadcast viewers) is drawn to her because they can feel something real bleeding through the performance.

### KUMIKO JACKSON — The Anchor

**Age:** 17. **Nationality:** Half Black American, half Japanese.

Kumiko is Lilith's second-in-command in PRISM and her closest friend — the only person Lilith trusts with her back in a fight. Where Lilith leads with fire, Kumiko leads with precision. She's the tactical mind, the one who plans the battles, manages the group's territory, and keeps Lilith from going too far.

Kumiko's programming is different from the others: she was conditioned as a "handler's assistant" — her job is to keep Lilith stable and functional. She doesn't know this. She thinks she's just a loyal friend. The horror of her arc is discovering that her deepest friendship was engineered.

**Her ability:** Photographic memory and accelerated pattern recognition. She can watch a fight once and predict every move in the rematch. The Consortium values this for battlefield analysis during contract operations.

**Musical role in PRISM:** Rapper/lyricist. She writes PRISM's songs — and the lyrics, if anyone were paying close enough attention, contain encoded fragments of the girls' real memories, surfacing through the cracks in the programming like dreams leaking into waking life.

### THE TWINS — MAI & YUI KAGURA

**Age:** 16. **Nationality:** Japanese.

Identical twins who are the most overtly supernatural members of PRISM. They share a genuine psychic link — they can communicate without speaking, feel each other's pain, and when they combine their focus, can achieve remote viewing over vast distances. The Consortium considers them their most valuable intelligence asset.

Mai is the extrovert — loud, theatrical, treats everything like a game. Yui is the introvert — quiet, watchful, always drawing in a sketchbook. The drawings are prophetic, though she doesn't realize it. The sketchbook becomes a crucial plot device: it contains images of events that haven't happened yet, including the school's destruction.

**Musical role in PRISM:** Harmonizers and dancers. Their synchronized movements are genuinely unsettling in their perfection — a visual manifestation of their psychic link.

### DR. LUKE VASQUEZ — The Handler

**Age:** 45. **Nationality:** American. **Trans woman (MTF).**

Dr. Luke is the school's "counselor" and the Consortium's chief programmer. She is the architect of every alter, every trigger phrase, every carefully constructed identity in the school. She is brilliant, methodical, and — this is what makes her terrifying — genuinely believes she is helping the girls.

In Dr. Luke's mind, these girls would be dead, institutionalized, or trafficked without the Consortium's intervention. The programming gives them purpose, identity, and a kind of stability they couldn't achieve on their own. She sees herself as a mother figure. This is not an act. She has a deep, twisted love for her "patients" that makes her far more frightening than a simple sadist would be.

**Her methods:** Based on real declassified MKUltra documentation — sensory deprivation, pain conditioning, pharmacological manipulation, and the deliberate creation of dissociative identity states through repeated trauma. The show does not flinch from depicting this. The programming scenes (influenced by Altered States) should be the most uncomfortable sequences in the series — visually abstract, aurally overwhelming, and emotionally devastating.

**Her arc:** Dr. Luke will be forced to confront what she's actually done. Not through external punishment, but through watching Lilith break free — watching the person she "created" reject everything she built. This is the cruelest thing the story can do to her: not vengeance, but irrelevance.

### DANIEL COLE — The Brother

**Age:** 22. **Nationality:** American.

Lilith's brother — except he's searching for Sarah, because he doesn't know "Lilith" exists. Daniel is our audience surrogate for the conspiracy B-plot. He's a college dropout, broke, directionless, consumed by the disappearance of his younger sister six years ago. The police gave up. His father (see below) told him to stop looking.

Daniel's investigation leads him to **JINX** — an online conspiracy theorist and hacker who operates under layers of paranoia, tinfoil-hat aesthetics, and surprisingly accurate intelligence. Jinx has found fragments of the Broadcast and has been trying to expose it for years, but no one believes him because he also believes in chemtrails and flat earth. The tragedy of Jinx is that he's right about the thing that matters, but his credibility is destroyed by everything else.

Daniel and Jinx form an unlikely partnership: the grieving brother and the conspiracy lunatic, slowly piecing together the truth from the outside while Lilith pieces it together from the inside. Their timelines converge in the season finale.

### COLONEL JAMES COLE — The Father

**Age:** 52. **Nationality:** American. **NSA.**

Lilith and Daniel's father. A high-ranking NSA intelligence officer who may or may not have been involved in placing his own daughter in the program. The show keeps this ambiguous for most of the season. James Cole knows more than he admits. He actively obstructs Daniel's search. He has meetings with Consortium representatives that he doesn't explain.

The truth, when it emerges, is more complicated than simple villainy: Cole was a participant in a precursor program. He recognized his daughter's psychic abilities early. He believed the Consortium could train her safely. He was wrong, and he knows it, but extracting her now would collapse an operation that protects national security interests. He has chosen his country over his daughter, and the guilt is eating him alive.

**His rival:** **DIRECTOR MARCUS FELL** — a CIA black-ops commander who serves as the Consortium's primary government liaison. Fell is inspired by Michael Aquino (the real-life Army officer associated with psychological operations and occult practices). Where Cole is conflicted, Fell is a true believer. He sees the Program as humanity's next evolutionary step. He wants to expand it globally.

### THE KAWAII WITCH — HEADMISTRESS SAKURA

**Age:** Appears 25. Actually unknown.

The school's true authority figure — above Mother Superior Helena, above Dr. Luke, answering directly to the Consortium's inner circle. Sakura presents as a hyper-cute, pastel-colored, perpetually smiling young woman who speaks in a sing-song voice and decorates her office with plushies and candy. This is not an act and it is not ironic. She is genuinely this way.

She is also centuries old, authentically supernatural, and the most dangerous person on the island.

Sakura is the reason the school is where it is. She's bound to the island — part of an ancient pact that the Consortium inherited when they took over the site. She manages the supernatural elements: the ghosts, the spiritual fault line, the boundary between worlds. The girls' exorcism missions are actually her maintenance work — she uses them to keep the boundary stable because she can't do it alone anymore.

Her motivation is survival. The Consortium gives her what she needs (the psychic energy generated by the girls' trauma feeds the boundary seal). In return, she gives them access to supernatural capabilities they can monetize. It's a business arrangement that's lasted decades.

**Her aesthetic:** Imagine if Kyary Pamyu Pamyu were an eldritch horror pretending to be a school administrator. Every scene with Sakura should be visually dissonant — kawaii surfaces over cosmic dread.

## Season 1 Arc — "Waking Up"

### Episode 1: "Enrollment Day"

Cold open: A contract kill in downtown Tokyo. Two girls in school uniforms dispatch a target in a nightclub bathroom with surgical efficiency. They're laughing. They think it's a game.

Cut to: PRISM performing at a sold-out stadium concert. 50,000 screaming fans. The performance is incredible — aggressive J-metal idol fusion, acrobatic choreography, genuine star power. Lilith is magnetic. This is the public face.

Cut to: The ferry to Tsukiyomi. Morning. Lilith wakes in her dorm, and we follow her through a "normal" school day — morning assembly with Mother Superior Helena, classes (that include hand-to-hand combat alongside literature), lunch in the quad where PRISM and ECLIPSE exchange threats across a territorial line, afternoon rehearsal, evening prayers in the bugged chapel.

The day is presented as completely normal through Lilith's eyes. The audience sees what Lilith doesn't: the cameras, the Nuns' concealed weapons, Dr. Luke watching through monitors, the broadcast indicators blinking in every room.

Final scene: Lilith alone in her room. She catches her reflection in the window and — for a split second — sees a different face. A younger face. Afraid. Then it's gone. She shakes it off. Goes to sleep.

Post-credits: Daniel in a cramped apartment in San Francisco, pinning photos to a conspiracy board. A photo of Lilith (as Sarah, age 11) next to a screenshot from the broadcast that Jinx sent him. He can't quite make the connection. Not yet.

### Episode 2: "The War Below"

Focus on the gang warfare. ECLIPSE, led by their captain **REIKA** (a calculating sociopath who may be the only student whose programming is wearing thin on purpose — she's been promoted to a semi-aware state as a reward), challenges PRISM for control of the Arena. The battle is brutal — baseball bats, chains, improvised weapons — filmed like a Crows fight sequence but with idol-girl aesthetics. Schoolgirls in modified uniforms beating each other bloody while their fans (the other students, organized into cheering sections) scream support.

During the fight, Mai takes a hit and Yui — across campus — collapses simultaneously. The psychic link is demonstrated viscerally.

B-plot: Dr. Luke conducts a "counseling session" with a younger student who's been showing "instability" (her programming is degrading). The session is shown in full: the room, the techniques, the pharmacological cocktail, the creation of a new alter to overwrite the failing one. This is the scene that establishes the show's moral position: we are watching abuse dressed up as care, and the show refuses to let you look away.

### Episode 3: "The Ghost in Room 4-C"

The supernatural element takes center stage. A genuine haunting disrupts the dormitory — cold spots, objects moving, a student wakes up speaking a language she doesn't know. Mother Superior Helena orders a containment mission. Lilith's team is deployed.

The exorcism sequence is where the show's genre collision hits hardest: Catholic ritual performed by genetically enhanced teenage soldiers in a haunted Japanese school, scored with distorted J-metal, intercut with Dr. Luke monitoring their vitals from the control room and Sakura watching with an expression that's equal parts satisfaction and hunger.

The ghost is real, the danger is real, and the girls handle it with practiced efficiency — but Lilith notices something during the exorcism: the ghost recognizes her. It says a name — "Sarah" — before it's dispelled.

B-plot: Daniel meets Jinx in person for the first time. Jinx's apartment is a nightmare of screens, printouts, and conspiracy strings. He shows Daniel fragments of the broadcast — low-resolution, heavily encrypted. Daniel sees girls fighting in what looks like a school. He doesn't recognize his sister. Yet.

### Episodes 4–7: Escalation

Each episode accelerates both the internal and external storylines:

**Internal (Lilith's awakening):** The cracks widen. Lilith starts having dreams that don't fit her memories. She finds a scar she can't explain. Kumiko notices behavioral changes and — because of her handler conditioning — reports them to Dr. Luke, then feels guilty about it without understanding why. The twins' sketchbook accumulates images that increasingly depict Lilith surrounded by fire, the school collapsing, a figure who looks like Daniel.

The musical numbers become a vehicle for the awakening: Lilith starts ad-libbing lyrics during performances. The ad-libs are fragments of Sarah's memories, surfacing as poetry. The audience doesn't understand. Dr. Luke does. She increases the programming sessions.

**External (Daniel's investigation):** Daniel and Jinx trace the broadcast signal. They recruit a former NSA analyst (who was quietly fired after asking questions about a program codenamed TSUKIYOMI). Colonel Cole learns that Daniel is getting close and deploys countermeasures — not violent ones, but bureaucratic: credit freezes, surveillance, social isolation. The father is trying to stop his son from finding his daughter, and the son starts to realize his father is involved.

**The rivalry escalates:** The Consortium's audience votes for an "escalation event" — a no-rules battle between PRISM and ECLIPSE with permanent consequences. The winning team gets privileges. The losing team gets "reassigned." Reika (ECLIPSE's leader) begins quietly approaching Lilith about a ceasefire, because she suspects what Lilith is only beginning to understand.

### Episode 8: "The Concert"

PRISM and ECLIPSE are scheduled for a joint televised concert — their public rivalry packaged as entertainment for millions of normal fans. This is the show's centerpiece episode: a full musical episode where the performances carry the narrative.

Lilith's performance is transcendent and terrifying. She goes off-script. The music transforms from polished idol-pop into something raw and primal. She's channeling Sarah. The audience in the stadium is mesmerized. The audience on the broadcast is alarmed. Dr. Luke is in the control room screaming to cut the feed. Sakura is watching from the wings with an expression we haven't seen before — fear.

During the performance, Daniel (who's been tracking the idol connection) sees a live broadcast of the concert on TV. He recognizes his sister's face for the first time.

### Episode 9: "Room Zero"

The aftermath. Lilith's concert breakdown triggers a facility-wide lockdown. Dr. Luke demands a full reprogramming. Mother Superior Helena objects — she's starting to suspect the truth. Sakura overrules them both and orders something called "Protocol Kaguya" — which involves the Undercroft.

Lilith is taken below the school for the first time. She sees the laboratories, the broadcast facility, the rooms where other girls — failed subjects — are kept in medical comas. She sees herself on a monitor labeled "ASSET: LILITH / ORIGIN: SARAH COLE / STATUS: DEGRADING."

Her programming shatters. Not gradually. Catastrophically. The alter called Lilith and the original called Sarah exist simultaneously and the cognitive dissonance is physically violent — telekinetic shockwaves, psychic screaming that the twins feel across the island, systems failing.

B-plot: Daniel, Jinx, and their ally breach the island. Colonel Cole is there too — he's come to extract his daughter, finally choosing family over country. Director Fell is also en route, with very different intentions.

### Episode 10: "Death Song" (死曲)

The convergence. Lilith/Sarah is loose in the Undercroft, power uncontrolled, reality bending around her. The Ninja Nuns are mobilized. Mother Superior Helena learns the truth about the broadcast and has a crisis of faith that manifests as her turning the Nuns against the Consortium. Reika leads ECLIPSE in an open revolt, not because she's heroic but because she's pragmatic — the operation is blown and she wants to survive.

Sakura reveals her true nature to contain the situation. The spiritual fault line destabilizes. Ghosts flood the campus. The boundary between worlds cracks open.

Daniel reaches Lilith. She doesn't recognize him. Sarah does. The final sequence intercuts between a desperate fight for survival and a musical performance — Lilith/Sarah singing alone in the burning chapel, a death song that's simultaneously a lullaby (Sarah's memory of her mother) and a war cry (Lilith's rage at what was done to her). The song holds the boundary together long enough for evacuation.

The school is destroyed. Sakura seals the breach, at great cost to herself. Dr. Luke escapes. Colonel Cole is wounded. Director Fell retreats with backup data. The Consortium is damaged but not destroyed.

Final scene: Lilith/Sarah on a boat leaving the island. Daniel beside her. She looks at him and says: "I don't know which one I am." He says: "We'll figure it out."

Post-credits: A Consortium facility in Switzerland. A new school. New girls. Dr. Luke, watching through cameras. She's already rebuilding.

## The Music

The soundtrack is essential to the identity of the show, not incidental.

**PRISM's sound:** Babymetal-influenced — J-metal with idol-pop vocals. Aggressive guitar riffs, double-bass drumming, but with melodic hooks and harmonized vocals that are genuinely catchy. Their performances should work as standalone music videos.

**ECLIPSE's sound:** Darker K-pop influence — trap beats, minor keys, whispered verses with explosive choruses. More choreography-focused. Precise, intimidating, sleek.

**Score:** Composed in two registers — a traditional orchestral/choir score for the supernatural and emotional moments (think Yoko Kanno's work on Ghost in the Shell: SAC), and an electronic/industrial score for the conspiracy and action sequences (think Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross).

**The Death Song itself** (Episode 10) should be the series' musical thesis — a piece that begins as a children's lullaby, transforms through progressive metal, and resolves into silence. It should make you cry and it should terrify you simultaneously.

---

## Themes

This is not exploitation for its own sake. The show has a moral position:

1. **The violence of being watched.** The broadcast is the show's central metaphor. The girls are traumatized for an audience's entertainment — and the viewer of our show is implicated. We're watching too. Every time we enjoy a fight scene, we're positioned alongside the Consortium's paying customers. The show knows this and uses it deliberately.

2. **Identity as construction.** Who are you if your personality was built by someone else? Lilith is a character created by Dr. Luke. Sarah is the "real" person underneath. But Lilith's experiences are real too. Her friendships are real. Her courage is real. The show argues that identity isn't about origin — it's about what you choose to do with what you've been given.

3. **The banality of institutional evil.** The Consortium isn't a cackling villain organization. It's a business. Dr. Luke isn't a monster. She's a professional who's rationalized her work. The Ninja Nuns aren't complicit. They're believers. The show's position is that the most dangerous evil is the kind that can justify itself.

4. **Survival as resistance.** The girls are weapons, but they're also people. Every moment of genuine friendship, real laughter, authentic creative expression — every time Kumiko writes a lyric that's actually hers, every time the twins communicate something private through their link, every time Lilith chooses mercy in a fight she could end with violence — is an act of resistance against the system designed to reduce them to assets.

## Commercial Potential

**Anime first:** 10-episode season, animation style mixing Ufotable-quality action sequences with Shaft-style psychological horror visuals. The musical performances are fully animated and produced as standalone tracks.

**Live-action adaptation:** The concept is designed for live-action. Japanese school setting, practical combat choreography, real musical performances. Think a Netflix/HBO co-production with a Japanese production partner.

**Manga companion:** Running alongside the anime, a manga series that explores backstories — each volume focused on a different student's life before the program.

**Music:** The PRISM and ECLIPSE albums are released as real products. The in-universe rivalry becomes a real-world marketing hook: fans choose sides. Concert tours are possible with live performers embodying the characters.

**Merchandise:** The show's visual aesthetic (the modified uniforms, the Ninja Nun designs, Sakura's kawaii-horror branding) is merchandising-ready.

**Connection to The Substrate/Academy:** The show's visual language, character archetypes, and factional rivalry system can inform The Academy's Layer 3 aesthetic without The Academy needing to carry any of the show's dark themes. PRISM and ECLIPSE become cultural references that The Academy users recognize — the relationship is "inspired by," not "adaptation of."

---

## What This Is Not

This is not edgy for the sake of edgy. Every dark element serves the themes. The mind control sequences are disturbing because mind control is disturbing and depicting it as anything less would be dishonest. The violence is brutal because the show's position is that violence done to teenage girls by powerful institutions should *feel* brutal, not choreographed and clean. The music is genuine because the show argues that art can be authentic even when it emerges from systems designed to suppress authenticity.

The show respects its characters. It respects its audience. It does not respect the institutions it depicts, and it does not pretend that watching is innocent.

That's the pitch.
